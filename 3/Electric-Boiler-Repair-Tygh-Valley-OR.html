<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. Once the wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately harden and treat-- typically two to 4 weeks.
