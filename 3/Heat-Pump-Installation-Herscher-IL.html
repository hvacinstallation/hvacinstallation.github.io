<p>Heaters are like vehicles. As they age, you can replace one part just need another part changed or fixed next year. It does not take long to spend $500 just to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Heaters sustain the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair sign is whether you needed to wait to get parts changed. As a furnace ages, it gets harder to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be truly cold on a below zero night.<p>
