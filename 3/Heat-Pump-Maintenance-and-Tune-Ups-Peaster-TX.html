<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>

<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by individuals and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
