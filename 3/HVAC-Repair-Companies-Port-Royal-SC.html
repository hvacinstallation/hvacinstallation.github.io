<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heater, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by distributing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a business was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to develop business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>

<p>Central air systems are determined in tons. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
