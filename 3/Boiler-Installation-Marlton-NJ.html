<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace specialists frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well.
