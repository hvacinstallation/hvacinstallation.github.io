<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace specialists frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A SEER score means Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio.

Generally, SEER supplies more data based on how the EER carries out in various temperatures. The higher the unit's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>
