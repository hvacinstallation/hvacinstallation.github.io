Perhaps Real estate agents must think about a lot of variables to definitively specify what a radiant heat system may contribute to, or subtract from, any given asking rate. That said, homebuyers looking to go green," who prioritize energy savings, or who definitely want an in-floor heating unit will be willing to pay a premium for a house that includes one.<p>
