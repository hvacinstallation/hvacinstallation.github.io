<p>Structures are designed or intended to react actively to some of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sterilize, and maintain surfaces to improve their appearance, longevity, or performance. In other cases, such modifications discreetly or even significantly change structures in ways that may be necessary to their own integrity or their effect on building occupants through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time. We might find it useful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, specifically, a few of the approaches used by researchers studying ecosystems, in order to gain an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we invest most of our time, our structures.<p>
