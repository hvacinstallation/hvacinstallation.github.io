<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room.
