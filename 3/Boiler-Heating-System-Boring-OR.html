<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>The primary health effect associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
