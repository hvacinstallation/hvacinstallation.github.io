I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space.

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
