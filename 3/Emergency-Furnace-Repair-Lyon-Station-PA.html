Your Sacramento HVAC technician will clean off the exterior of the unit and make sure that there is no rust, damage from built up wetness, or excessive wear to the outside. They might recommend that you trim back overgrown trees or bushes to make sure appropriate airflow around the system.<p>

They consist of both human-made and naturally taking place chemical compounds. Chemical pollutants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the building (e.g., office devices; wall, flooring and furniture coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are especially at risk.

Exposure to secondhand smoke causes eye, throat, and nose inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
