One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are forced to resist current, which then generates heat.<p>

<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These items present a risk only when they are handled in a way that produces dust containing asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing products are damaged or disrupted by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can end up being air-borne if proper controls are not in place. This can result in the potential for substantial health issue.<p>
