<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Pelham AL</h3>
<p>Sean was really helpful. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>

While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still needed to have an expert technician inspect the system regularly.<p>
