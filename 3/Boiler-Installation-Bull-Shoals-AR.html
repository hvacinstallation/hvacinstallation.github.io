<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
