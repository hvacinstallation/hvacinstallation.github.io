<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>

This could be through a public offering, a sale to a big service in the field, or even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, previously this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
