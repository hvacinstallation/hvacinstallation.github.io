<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Black Hawk CO</h3>
<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to reduce the amount of energy needed for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, actions need to likewise be required to reduce pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for advised actions.) In addition, homeowners must look out to the development of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization steps should not be carried out until these issues have been fixed.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot beside the radiators. This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat provides heat from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>

As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
