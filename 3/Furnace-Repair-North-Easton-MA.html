<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, houses and schools matters, particularly considering that we spend most of our lives inside. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in very humid environments or in cases where the air conditioner is oversized, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioning system will need more energy to cool your house. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives typically total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can typically make the preliminary price of a system competitive with standard devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout brand-new construction (houses generally utilize in between one and 5 tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. Nevertheless, brand-new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to standard systems under the right conditions.<p>

<p>A specialized air conditioning unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the same air course. Since its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, since all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is actually heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
