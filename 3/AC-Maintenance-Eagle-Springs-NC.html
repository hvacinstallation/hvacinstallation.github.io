<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Eagle Springs NC</h3>

On those days when you just can't seem to heat up and find you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses throbbing. Since they heat surface areas and not the air itself, in-floor heating systems are not susceptible to this problem. Furthermore, considering that they do not trust fans, ducts, returns and signs up to distribute hot air, in-floor heating unit can decrease the quantity of dust and seasonal allergens in your house.<p>
<p>Examine these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
