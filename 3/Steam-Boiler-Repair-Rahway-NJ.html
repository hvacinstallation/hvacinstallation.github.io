<p>Information offered in this security guide is based on current clinical and technical understanding of the concerns provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. The standards do not require you to change your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services need to still be offered for your house's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioner has to do with 15 to 20 years. Manufacturers usually continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance agreements after the new standard goes into effect.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can become obstructed with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to close down completely. By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can usually be carried out in just a few minutes, typically with no tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
