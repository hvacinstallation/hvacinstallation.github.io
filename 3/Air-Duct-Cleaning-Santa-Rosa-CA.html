<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri. Mentioning laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a efficient and straightforward method to minimize ambient air pollution and possible health risks, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce toxins.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The goal is to supply sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
