<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>

Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke causes throat, nose, and eye irritation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have linked direct exposure to secondhand smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
