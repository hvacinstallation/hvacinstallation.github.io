<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, however it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are great for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system individually, considering that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are typically only readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity.

Therefore, this might not be the very best option for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
