<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called 2 local companies for bids. While both were helpful and handy, Ballard Natural Gas provided us a better deal, for remarkable service. Rather than an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating system and located methods we might have more even heat. He included these substantial but small modifications in his bid. We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump because of current warmer summers and for environmental reasons.<p>
