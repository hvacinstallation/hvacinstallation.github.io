Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward procedure. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>
