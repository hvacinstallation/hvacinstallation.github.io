<p>Reality: Federal and local incentives generally total up to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial price of a system competitive with conventional devices. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout new building and construction (houses usually use in between one and 5 heaps).
