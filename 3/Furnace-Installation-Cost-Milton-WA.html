<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
