<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was sort of weird being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was extremely lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we fixed issues. I would advise this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time.
