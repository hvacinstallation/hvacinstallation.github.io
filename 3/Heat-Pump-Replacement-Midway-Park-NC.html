<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>A geothermal heater does not generate its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as oil, coal, or gas. Instead, it absorbs heat from within the earth. Furthermore, a geothermal cooling and heating system uses substantially less electricity compared to a standard electric heat-resistance heatpump. This makes a geothermal heating system an attractive option to cut your carbon footprint, supplying a positive impact on the environment.<p>
<p>Selecting the best size central air conditioning system for your home is extremely important, as is choosing either a plan system, which keeps condenser, fan and coil all in one unit, or a split system, which places the condenser outside the fan and the home and coil within.
