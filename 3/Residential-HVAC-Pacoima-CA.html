<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair at Pacoima CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
