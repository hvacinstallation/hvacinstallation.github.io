<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
