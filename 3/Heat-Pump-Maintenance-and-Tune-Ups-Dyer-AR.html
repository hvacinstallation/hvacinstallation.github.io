<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that best temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those typical air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in costly repairs down the road. So, make certain to change your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service plan which typically includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
