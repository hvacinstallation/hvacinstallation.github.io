<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you ought to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system.
