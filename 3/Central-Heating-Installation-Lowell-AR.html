<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtration. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some basic maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne pollutants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping reduce the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>There are a few possibilities to explain brief biking in very cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high needs put on the system due to the extremely low temperatures. In some cases, the furnace will simply run harder to maintain a warm environment for your home when the weather condition is extremely cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. Contact one of our technicians if you need clearness on this concern.<p>
<p>Begin by calling RJ Heating if your furnace stops working. We typically discover that a basic repair or adjustment is all that's required to help it run appropriately once again.

<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, however it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have an unfavorable effect on residents-- outside air must be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
