<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, however to have two major elements fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by warranty.
