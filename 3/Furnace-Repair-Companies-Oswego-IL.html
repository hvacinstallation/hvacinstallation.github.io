Not all furnaces benefit all houses, and there are a couple of aspects that definitely need to be considered before selecting one. Initially, you'll require one that is effectively sized for your home. A furnace that is too large will put out excessive heat for your system to manage, and will trigger issues like short-cycling that can reduce its life.

<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise houses bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually seen the single-family house installation company completely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to up to three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with newbies more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle property owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
