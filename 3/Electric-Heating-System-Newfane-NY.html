<p>You're motivating the development of mold in wet air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, preventing mold development and contamination. Naturally, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the development of germs and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
