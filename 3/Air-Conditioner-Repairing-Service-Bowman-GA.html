<p>I am changing our High Speed System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an extra $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as crucial when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to effectively cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have concerns, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
