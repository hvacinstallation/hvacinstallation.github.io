<p>Professional heater setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC professionals advise following this basic rule when choosing whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than required.<p>

<p>Glowing heating systems do not utilize ducts, that makes them quite a bit more energy effective than other systems. They also do not develop cold and hot areas.
