Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
