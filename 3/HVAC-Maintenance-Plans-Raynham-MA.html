<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning system works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
