(He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<h3>Appropriate Things To Look Out For In Your Olema CA Commercial HVAC Service Provider</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
