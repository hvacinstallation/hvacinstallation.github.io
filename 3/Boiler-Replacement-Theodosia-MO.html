<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service at Theodosia MO</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are very efficient, due to the fact that ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a constant temperature level. These systems can achieve a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only obtain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling result. Most ground source heatpump have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for each unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
