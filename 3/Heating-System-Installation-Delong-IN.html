<p>While toxins commonly found in indoor air are responsible for many harmful effects, there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of exposure are needed to produce particular health problems. Individuals also respond very in a different way to direct exposure to indoor air contaminants. Additional research is needed to much better understand which health effects happen after direct exposure to the typical contaminant concentrations discovered in houses and which occur from the higher concentrations that occur for brief time periods.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
