<h3>Clogged Air Filters in Peace Valley MO</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
