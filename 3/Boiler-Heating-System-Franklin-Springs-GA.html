<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may notice undesirable or moldy odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, talk with your physician about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heating system seems less like a luxury product and more like a necessity. (Besides, heated up floors were excellent enough for the Roman Empire) However prior to you devote to what can be a major improvement task, it's best to ask yourself whether a radiant flooring heater is an appropriate option for your specific house heating needs.<p>
