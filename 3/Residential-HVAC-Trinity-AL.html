<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ may see unpleasant or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
