<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
