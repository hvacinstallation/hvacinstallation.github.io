<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump units can have different heating and cooling capacities.

<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, wall, ceiling, and floor coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days may become a source for mold growth and must be discarded.

In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, opportunities exist will be mold growing close by. Fix the moisture problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely tidy the area utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
