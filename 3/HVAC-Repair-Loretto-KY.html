<p>A geothermal heating unit is more trustworthy than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external elements, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For instance, wind energy can just be utilized when there is wind, while solar power counts on regular sunlight to work effectively.

This makes geothermal heating a trustworthy and available source of energy.<p>
