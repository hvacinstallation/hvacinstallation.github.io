We clean, sterilize, and keep surface areas to boost their appearance, efficiency, or longevity. In other cases, such modifications subtly or perhaps significantly modify structures in ways that might be important to their own integrity or their influence on structure residents through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that define them at any time. We may find it beneficial to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, particularly, some of the methods utilized by researchers studying environments, in order to acquire an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we spend the majority of our time, our buildings.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
