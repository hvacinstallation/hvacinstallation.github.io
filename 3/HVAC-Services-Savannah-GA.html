Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems other than the blower motor.

<h3>Central Air Conditioner Installation in Savannah GA</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the concern. He is sincere, trusted, and affordable on cost. It's hard to find a truthful AC person and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

Our group does excellent work, whether it's dealing with traditional HVAC work or handling the quirks of brownstones, prewar buildings and other structures hard to heat or cool.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were excellent! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They satisfied my requirements entirely by supplying an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing additional products. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also quickly followed up with the needed assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Just an expert can properly diagnose why your furnace isn't starting. It's time to call an expert if at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something appears weird or you lose confidence. Similarly, if the procedure does not work, something else is incorrect and you require a technician to analyze the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you find you need to do it frequently, it's probably time for a professional opinion.<p>
