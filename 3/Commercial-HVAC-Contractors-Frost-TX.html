<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC unit is wintry. Also, if the air conditioning unit smells bad, there might be bacteria buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil absorbs the heat away from your home. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioning system's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Some health impacts may appear shortly after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures to a pollutant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant results are treatable and usually short-term. Often the treatment is just eliminating the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized.

<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
