<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested informing me about our system, and left having resolved the issue with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part.

<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives typically total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the preliminary price of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout brand-new building (houses usually use in between one and 5 loads). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap.
