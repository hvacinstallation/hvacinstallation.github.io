<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested informing me about our system, and left having resolved the issue with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part.

His time and know-how to FIX the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a rather unsure diagnostic.<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives typically total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the preliminary price of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout brand-new building (houses usually use in between one and 5 loads). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. However, new installation practices are minimizing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to conventional systems under the right conditions.<p>
