<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning On Your Gainesville FL Home</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Since 1985, the Department of Housing and Urban Advancement (HUD) has permitted only using plywood and particleboard that conform to specified formaldehyde emission limitations in the building of upraised and mobile homes. In the past, a few of these houses had elevated levels of formaldehyde because of the large quantity of high-emitting pushed wood products used in their construction and because of their fairly little interior area.<p>
