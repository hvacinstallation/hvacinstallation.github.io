<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices usually lasts decades, considering that it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely.
