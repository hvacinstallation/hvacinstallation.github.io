A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems.
