<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers used different approaches. The CMHC research study gotten in touch with several duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they were part of a study, and the researchers did not control for time spent or techniques utilized. The EPA study prescribed and controlled techniques utilized on a smaller sized number of homes. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both research studies have defects, no other research has challenged the findings.

<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Crocker MO</h3>
<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you employ to install your central air unit. In truth, you can even Do It Yourself, regardless of our strong suggestion not to do so. Expect to pay between $300 and $1,000 in labor costs to install central air if you do take our recommendation. Additionally, cooling contractors might charge an extra $50 to $200 for additional materials and devices.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
