<p>The primary health result related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
