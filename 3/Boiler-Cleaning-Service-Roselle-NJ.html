<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
