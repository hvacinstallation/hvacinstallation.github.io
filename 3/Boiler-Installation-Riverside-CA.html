<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that secure your a/c system from flooding. Among the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent chance; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen.
