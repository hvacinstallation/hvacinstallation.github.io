<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2.

Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be required.<p>
<p>If you believe there is a health issue associated to the indoor environment, please schedule an appointment for a medical examination at the University Staff Member Occupational Health Center by calling 919-966-9119. At this time, you will be asked to finish the Ask for Indoor Air Quality Investigation form (discovered in the Indoor Air Quality Policy).
