<p>The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends on a number of elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important impacts. In other cases, whether a person responds to a pollutant depends on individual sensitivity, which varies greatly from individual to individual. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological contaminants after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants as well.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to manage than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
