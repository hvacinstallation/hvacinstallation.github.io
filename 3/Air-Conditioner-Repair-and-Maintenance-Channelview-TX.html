Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
