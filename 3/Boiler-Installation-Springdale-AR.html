<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to look out for is the dust that gathers during summer seasons. The best thing to do is making certain that the heating unit burners are inspected and cleaned up completely prior to colder seasons start.

<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in efficiency benefit since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Due to the fact that they do not need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Because a system is installed in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
