<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ¬∞ C (40-55 ¬∞ F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
