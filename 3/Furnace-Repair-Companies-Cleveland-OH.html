<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan.

Loosen the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>
