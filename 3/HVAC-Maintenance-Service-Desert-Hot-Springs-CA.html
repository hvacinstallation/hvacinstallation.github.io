<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 2 days might become a source for mold development and should be discarded. Often there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can thrive in concealed or seldom accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic.

If a source of water or condensation can be found, chances exist will be mold growing nearby. Repair the wetness issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the location utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
