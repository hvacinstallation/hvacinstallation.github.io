<h3>Assessing the Performance of Your HVAC System in Spartanburg SC</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, determined particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
