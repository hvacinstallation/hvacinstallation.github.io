<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may enter nearby ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
