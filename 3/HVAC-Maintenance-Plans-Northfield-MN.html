<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Due to the fact that it is impossible to see, smell or taste, CO can eliminate you prior to you know it remains in your home. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO triggers mild impacts that are often incorrect for the flu. These symptoms include headaches, dizziness, disorientation, tiredness and queasiness. The results of CO direct exposure can differ greatly from person to person depending on age, overall health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
