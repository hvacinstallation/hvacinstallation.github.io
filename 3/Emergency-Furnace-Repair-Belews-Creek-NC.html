<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
