<p>The federal government recommends that houses be weatherized in order to reduce the amount of energy needed for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, actions ought to also be taken to decrease pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for advised actions.) In addition, citizens need to be alert to the development of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization procedures ought to not be carried out till these problems have actually been remedied.<p>
<p>We take a look at hints before we provide recommendations to change rather than repair a heater. Among the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
