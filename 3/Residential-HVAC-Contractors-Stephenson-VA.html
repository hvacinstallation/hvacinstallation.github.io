<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters houses through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains pipes, and sumps. When radon ends up being trapped in buildings and concentrations build up inside, direct exposure to radon ends up being an issue.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit conveniently into the window, be sure to have those dimensions on hand.
