<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an airborne item of a biological contaminant. Biological contaminants in the house may include mold, germs, infections, termites, and pollen. Bioaerosols launched into the air can be distributed throughout the home by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can trigger infectious illness such as Legionnaires' disease. They also can cause allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Symptoms caused by biological toxins consist of sneezing, eye inflammation, coughing, dizziness, and breathing infections.<p>
