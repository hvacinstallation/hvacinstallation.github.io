The majority of commonly they are mounted at height-level or somewhat lower, if people mostly stay seated in that particular area. However, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate towards the floor or ceiling; depending on what contaminant you're trying to track you'll need to place the sensor accordingly.
