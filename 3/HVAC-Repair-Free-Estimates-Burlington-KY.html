<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
