<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
