<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in automobiles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by qualified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by lots of individuals.<p>
