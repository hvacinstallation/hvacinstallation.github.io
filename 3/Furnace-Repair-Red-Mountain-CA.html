The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (revealed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends on keeping it according to the manufacturer's instructions.<p>
