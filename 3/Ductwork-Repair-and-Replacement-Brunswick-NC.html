<p>I typically do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
