<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
