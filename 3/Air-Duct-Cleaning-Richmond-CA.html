<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
