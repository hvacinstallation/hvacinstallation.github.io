It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the patio where the unit sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
