<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Tyngsboro MA</h3>
<p>Aspects that can contribute to the growth of biological impurities are moist or damp building materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and inadequately preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning unit. "Humidifier fever" is a common illness brought on by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Numerous fungi and bacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these contaminants can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are family pets and household plants.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
