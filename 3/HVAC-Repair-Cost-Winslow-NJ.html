<p>Oil furnaces are normally not very effective. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however the majority of do not attain an effectiveness greater than 90%. A few high-end brands have a performance of 95% by using a condenser. These are more pricey, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Because a drain needs to be set up, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that best temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to costly repairs down the road. So, make certain to change your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which generally includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>

After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me.
