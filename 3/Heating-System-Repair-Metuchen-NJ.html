If your heating unit is 25 years of ages or more, you can probably expect to cut your fuel expenses in half.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside system as near your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
