<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
