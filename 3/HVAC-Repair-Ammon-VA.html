<p>One of the downsides of central heating is that it's possibly expensive to set up, especially in an older house. Depending on the kind of unit set up, it can be loud and cause problems if you're extremely allergic to dust. Additionally, specific fuels and equipment might require unique authorizations, and there is limited versatility in case of changed heating requirements. During usage, there is a time delay while heat is being carried from the heating unit to the living space.<p>

At lower levels of direct exposure, CO causes moderate results that are typically incorrect for the flu. These signs include headaches, dizziness, disorientation, nausea and fatigue.
