<p>Due to the fact that they get rid of moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area.

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Central air conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floorings, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c unit to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
