<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material in time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
