<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you need to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
