<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Though it may be difficult to believe, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air exterior.
