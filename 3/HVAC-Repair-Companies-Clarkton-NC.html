<p>Typically the most reliable way to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is likewise a more cost-effective technique to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later on in this area.<p>

The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
