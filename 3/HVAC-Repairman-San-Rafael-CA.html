<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Companies in San Rafael</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Professional heating system setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately stop working. HVAC experts advise following this basic rule when deciding whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>

<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in San Rafael CA</h3>

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
