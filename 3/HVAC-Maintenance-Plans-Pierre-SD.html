<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers utilized various methodologies. The CMHC study contacted numerous duct-cleaning services. The companies were not warned they were part of a study, and the researchers did not control for time invested or techniques utilized. The EPA research study recommended and controlled approaches utilized on a smaller sized variety of homes.

<p>Plan on investing several thousand dollars for the total system if you are thinking about installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you do not have one in your home. The size of the system figures out the labor hours included to build the system. To outfit a home with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand new furnace or more when you think about installation charges upwards of $50 per hour.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may wish to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You might look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capacity and performance if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to look for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one major drawback of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or incredibly hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
