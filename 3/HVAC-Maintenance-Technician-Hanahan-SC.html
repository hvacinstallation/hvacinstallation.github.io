Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was respectful of my home and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install evaluation outcomes look great for braising and plumbing quality.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to offer sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
