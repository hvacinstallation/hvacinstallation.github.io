<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming typical features of environment-friendly homes as part of the growing green building movement. Green jobs accounted for 20 percent of all recently built houses in the U.S. in 2015. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal post forecasted that green housing will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole real estate market.<p>

In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
