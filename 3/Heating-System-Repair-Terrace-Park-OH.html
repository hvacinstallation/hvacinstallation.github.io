An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
