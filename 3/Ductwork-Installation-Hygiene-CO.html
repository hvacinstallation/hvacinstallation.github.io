Due to the fact that they only partially get rid of the radon decay items and do not decrease the amount of radon entering the home, the effectiveness of these devices is uncertain. EPA prepares to do extra research study on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a reliable means of lowering the health danger from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, offers more details on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air contaminants.<p>
