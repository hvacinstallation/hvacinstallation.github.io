<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area.

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. During high use months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
