<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance in Fountain NC</h3>
<p>The icing issue ends up being a lot more serious with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more conventional type of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used rather of the heatpump during harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heatpump is utilized effectively during the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
