Since they just partly get rid of the radon decay products and do not diminish the quantity of radon getting in the house, the effectiveness of these gadgets is unpredictable.

EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers additional information on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air toxins.<p>
