<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>Terrific service within 24 hr and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely extensive in describing what services would be carried out. Likewise Camryn provided excellent customer service at the end of the appointment by discussing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance tasks we might want to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale methods used by some in the market.<p>
