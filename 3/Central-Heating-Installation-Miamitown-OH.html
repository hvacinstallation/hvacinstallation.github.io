<p>Check these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
