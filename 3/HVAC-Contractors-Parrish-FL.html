<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a variety of sources; the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually determined building materials, furnishings, and mold as major issues, but much of the risk also originates from burning things. For example, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can create pollution in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially huge problem in the establishing world.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new houses are beginning to include mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home. A few of these designs include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (likewise referred to as air-to-air heat exchangers).
