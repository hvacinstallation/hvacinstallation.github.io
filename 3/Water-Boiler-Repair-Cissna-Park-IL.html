<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
