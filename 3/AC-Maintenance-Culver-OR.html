<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor might be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the correct temperature. Heating systems that kick on regularly might be because of a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is easy to set up, especially if you make it part of a develop or renovation task.
