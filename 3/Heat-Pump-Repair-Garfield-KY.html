<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very pleased that someone as experienced as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the air conditioning unit before you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Don't worry! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it just may need 24 volts of electrical power.
