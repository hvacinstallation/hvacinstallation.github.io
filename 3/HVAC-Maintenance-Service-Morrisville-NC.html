<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, considering that it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical guidelines remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to function.<p>

<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
