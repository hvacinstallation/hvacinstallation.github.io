I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem. He is sincere, reliable, and sensible on cost. It's difficult to discover an honest AC man and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
