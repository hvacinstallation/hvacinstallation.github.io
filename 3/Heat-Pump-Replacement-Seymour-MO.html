<p>Sean was really helpful. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor.
