Many pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't just break at the breeze of a finger, however instead is the result of recurring usage of a component that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early wear and tear, causing holes and cracks. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the part.. an extremely useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
