<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heatpump While room air conditioning offers maximum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more costly than central air.<p>
