<h3>Repair and Care for East Alton IL Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system. We selected getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our most significant energy expenses.
