<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Fort Lee VA</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are exceptionally efficient, due to the fact that ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is always at a consistent temperature level.

Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). COP rates how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling impact.
