<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly minimizes exposure to pollutants during cooking. Inappropriate adjustment, typically suggested by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue. Consider buying one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot light that burns constantly if you purchase a new gas range or variety. Never utilize a gas range to heat your house. Always ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>
