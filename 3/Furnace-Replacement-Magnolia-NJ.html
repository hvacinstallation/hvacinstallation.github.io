<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
