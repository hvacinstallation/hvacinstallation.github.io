"Humidifier fever" is a common disease brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs.

Other possible sources of biological contaminants are animals and home plants.<p>
<p>There's a big difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical form of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, the majority of houses in colder climates were heated up by convection, instead of radiation. Convection is the procedure of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the ceilings, floorings and walls heated. In turn, the things in the room, like furniture and people, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
