<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Jayess MS?</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various home effectiveness upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to help us debate which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's items and services was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to perform the required electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
