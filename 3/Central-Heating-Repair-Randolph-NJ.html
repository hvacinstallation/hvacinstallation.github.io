Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A split a/c consists of 2 primary parts - a compressor located outside and an inside air outlet system.

<h3>How to Select a Specialist HVAC Tech in Randolph NJ</h3>
