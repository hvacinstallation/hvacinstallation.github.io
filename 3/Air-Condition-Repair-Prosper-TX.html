R-600 (isobutane) is already extensively used in residential refrigeration.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
