<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>
