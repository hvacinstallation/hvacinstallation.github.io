<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a recommendation later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
