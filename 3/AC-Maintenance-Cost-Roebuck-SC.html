<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roofing system, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for homeowners to think about. Many times, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system separately, considering that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are usually only readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best alternative for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
