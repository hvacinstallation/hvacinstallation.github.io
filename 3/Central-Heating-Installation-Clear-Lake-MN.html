<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the check out. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was extremely pleased they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
