<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner at Holly Ridge NC</h3>
<p>Aspects that can add to the development of biological impurities are wet or damp building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and poorly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c. "Humidifier fever" is a typical health problem caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Various fungi and bacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these impurities can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are animals and home plants.<p>

<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective if your house or building has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
