<p>Because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for performance. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

Does your blower turn on and off frequently or does it blow cold air in some cases? If so, this is a sign that your furnace may require to be changed.<p>
