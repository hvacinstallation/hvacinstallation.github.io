<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same contaminants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>If you work in building, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your pastime includes lead, you might unconsciously bring lead into your house on your hands or clothing. You may also be tracking in lead from soil around your home. Soil very near homes may be polluted from lead paint on the outside of the building. Soil by roads and highways may be infected from years of exhaust fumes from automobiles and trucks that utilized leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet before going into the house. If you work with lead in your task or a hobby, alter your clothing before you go home and wash these clothing individually. Motivate your kids to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirt which adheres to fingers and toys. Try to keep your kids from eating dirt, and make sure they clean their hands when they come within.<p>

<p>Many people undervalue the degree of the indoor air contamination problem. Air contamination is generally imagined as the black smoke released from factories. Little idea is given to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, paints, pesticides, and cleaners used in the home.

<p>When our furnace was dying, we called 2 local companies for bids. While both were valuable and helpful, Ballard Gas provided us a much better deal, for extraordinary service. Instead of a basic sales task, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating unit and located methods we could have more even heat. He consisted of these substantial but small adjustments in his quote. Due to the fact that of recent warmer summers and for ecological factors, we chose to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>The most harmful asbestos fibers are too little to be visible. After they are inhaled, they can accumulate and stay in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be fatal). Symptoms of these diseases do not show up until several years after direct exposure started. The majority of people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to elevated concentrations on the task; some developed disease from exposure to clothing and devices brought house from job websites.<p>
