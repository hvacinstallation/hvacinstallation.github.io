<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
