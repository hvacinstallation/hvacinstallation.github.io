<h3>The Way to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews at Welcome NC</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
