<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you might not have a problem as long as your home still heats up to the best temperature. The temperature of the air produced by the heatpump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel extremely hot. Only be worried if your home is not heating up.
