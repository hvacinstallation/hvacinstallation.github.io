<p>Though it may be tough to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are well-known for lowering the air quality in your house, but there are many other toxins that can not just dirty up the air, but result in other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and building products add to bad air quality, and can likewise trigger cancers.

<p>Indoor environments are highly complex and building residents might be exposed to a range of impurities (in the form of particles and gases) from workplace makers, cleaning products, building and construction furnishings, activities and carpets, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor toxins. Other aspects such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how people react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>The primary health effect associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer.
