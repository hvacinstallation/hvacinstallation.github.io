This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While space a/c supplies optimum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is usually more costly than central air.<p>
