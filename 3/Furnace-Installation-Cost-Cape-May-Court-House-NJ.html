<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
