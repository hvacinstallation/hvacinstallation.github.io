<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they give me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
