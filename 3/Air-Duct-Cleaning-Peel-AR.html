<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
