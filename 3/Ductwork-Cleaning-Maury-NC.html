<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was sort of unusual being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was extremely lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we resolved issues. I would recommend this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough job that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps men working. When a sales guy comes to your house he exists to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and should not "require" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on.
