<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that may impact the health of people who live in the house. Pollutants might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering the house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant could likewise originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, unstable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care products. Germs and viruses, family pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off contaminants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
