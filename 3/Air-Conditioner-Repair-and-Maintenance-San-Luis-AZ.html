<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of brand-new houses are starting to include mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the house. Some of these designs include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (likewise called air-to-air heat exchangers). For more details about air-to-air heat exchangers, contact the Preservation and Renewable Resource Query and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
