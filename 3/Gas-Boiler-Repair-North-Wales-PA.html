The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air helps and waters down indoor impurities exhaust them from the home.<p>
