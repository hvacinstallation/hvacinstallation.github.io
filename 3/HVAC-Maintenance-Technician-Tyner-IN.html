(If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>They were great! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested.
