<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
