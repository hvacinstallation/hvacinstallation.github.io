<p>Through typical use and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning unit may become very unclean.

The system is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic components are examineded for correct function and overall condition. This is an outstanding chance to identify parts that are worn or faulty. When the issue is fairly minor, replacing them to repair the air conditioning might be a lot less costly.<p>
