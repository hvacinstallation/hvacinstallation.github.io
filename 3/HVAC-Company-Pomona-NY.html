<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, many of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>You might upgrade to the greatest performance equipment available and still not feel easily cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are just part of the central air system. The typical house's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to choosing whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining how much air escapes the system.<p>

<p>Through regular use and the unit's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioner might become very dirty. These aspects of the equipment are vital for efficient air conditioning.
