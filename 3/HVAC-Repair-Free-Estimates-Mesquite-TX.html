<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
