<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
