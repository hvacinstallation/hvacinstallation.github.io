<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years ago and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
