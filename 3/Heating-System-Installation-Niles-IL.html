<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
