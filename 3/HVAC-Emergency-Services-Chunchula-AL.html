<p>There are some ranges of mold which contain hazardous compounds (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible most of the times, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the released spores.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
