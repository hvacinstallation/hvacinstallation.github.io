<p>Unstable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from procedures or items; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of brand-new homes are starting to include mechanical systems that bring outside air into the home. Some of these designs include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (also known as air-to-air heat exchangers). For more information about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Conservation and Renewable Energy Query and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
