<p>Indoor air contamination originates from a range of sources; the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually identified building products, home furnishings, and mold as serious issues, but much of the danger also comes from burning things.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
