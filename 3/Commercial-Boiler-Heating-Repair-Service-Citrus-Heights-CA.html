<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Citrus Heights CA</h3>
<p>Another approach to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside your home. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of impurities directly from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
