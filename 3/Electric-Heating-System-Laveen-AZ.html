I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance.

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
