<p>Volatile natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from processes or items; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
