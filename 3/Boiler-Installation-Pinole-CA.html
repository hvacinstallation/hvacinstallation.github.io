PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While space air conditioning provides maximum versatility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is normally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>

<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by individuals and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
