<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
