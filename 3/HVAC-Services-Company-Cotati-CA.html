<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run. Because it just takes more electrical power to run a larger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
