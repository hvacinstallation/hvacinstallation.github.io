<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke triggers throat, nose, and eye irritation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have connected direct exposure to pre-owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
