<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
