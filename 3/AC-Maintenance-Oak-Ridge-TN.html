<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my companies, my own houses and my realty clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he assisted me problem shoot the concern.
