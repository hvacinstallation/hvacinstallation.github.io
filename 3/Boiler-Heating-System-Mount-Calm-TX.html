<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, class or laboratory environments, instead of industrial or outside settings. In jobs where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the building. It might likewise include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to individual spaces.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single check out, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance visits each year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and normally some other benefits. Some companies provide top priority visits to their maintenance strategy members.<p>

I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the new part.
