<p>Correct ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside.

According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses oil, gas or electrical power to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in individual spaces.
