<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace specialists frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing in Comer GA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit.

Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in vehicles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by qualified HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by lots of people.<p>
