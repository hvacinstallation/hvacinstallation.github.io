<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Euclid OH</h3>
<p>Area Ventilation. Exterior exhaust fans need to be set up in all cooking areas and restrooms. These fans eliminate humidity and carbon monoxide gas. The most efficient fans are long lasting and quiet. Usage fans that operate at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans equipped with timers or de-humidistat controls are useful to make sure the fans run for an enough time period. An excellent rule of thumb is to run a bathroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
