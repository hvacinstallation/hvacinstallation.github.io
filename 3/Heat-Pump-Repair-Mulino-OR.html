<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you need to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
