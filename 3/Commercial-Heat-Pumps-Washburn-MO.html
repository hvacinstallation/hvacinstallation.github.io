<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must watch out for. First, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
