<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to effectively service and the unit has been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
