<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump.

An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
