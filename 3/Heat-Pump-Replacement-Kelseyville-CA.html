<h3>Air Conditioner Repairs Near me in Kelseyville CA</h3>
<p>The fact is, air contamination in your home can be simply as bad - or even worse - than it is outdoors.

<h3>HVAC Systems Are a Must for All Homes and Offices in Kelseyville CA</h3>
<p>I have been using Waychoff for about ten years. Initially, they fixed a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have actually preserved my system semi-annually. Their techs are professional and very knowledgeable. Costs are affordable. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser today. I did not bother to get rival's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff because the cost was undoubtedly reasonable.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in autos in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by many people.<p>
