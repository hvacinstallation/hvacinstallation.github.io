<h3>House Ventilation in Belton SC</h3>

They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
