<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (revealed as a portion efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (revealed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the producer's directions.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outside metal cabinet contains the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet consists of the evaporator.
