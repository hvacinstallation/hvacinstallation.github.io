<h3>Heating Duct in Kent WA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
