<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
