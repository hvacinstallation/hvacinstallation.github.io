<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
