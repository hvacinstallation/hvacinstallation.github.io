The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
