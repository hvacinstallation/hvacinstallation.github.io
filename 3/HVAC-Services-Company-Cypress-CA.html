<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends upon a number of factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends on individual level of sensitivity, which varies significantly from person to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to chemical or biological pollutants after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>

The primary risk of mold growth, as it relates to indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More serious than a lot of allergenic properties is the capability of mold to trigger episodes personallies that already have asthma, a severe respiratory illness.<p>

<p>Outside pollutants. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and irritants discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates.

He dedicated to the task based only on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few sensible ones got. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my house and set up the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post install examination results look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 unit it replaced (also Provider).<p>
