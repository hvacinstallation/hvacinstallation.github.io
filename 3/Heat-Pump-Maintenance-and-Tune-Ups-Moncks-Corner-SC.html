<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Moncks Corner SC</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
