<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Moncks Corner SC</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c".

When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
