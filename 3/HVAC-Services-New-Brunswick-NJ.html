<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works at New Brunswick NJ?</h3>
<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while concurrently removing waste gases and particulates. Needless to state, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the harder it is for your lungs to remove them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside or outdoors - can make it increasingly difficult for your lungs to operate effectively, and can have unfavorable health impacts.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
