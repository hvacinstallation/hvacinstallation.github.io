<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Think about potential effects of indoor air pollution if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heater. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, specifically directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit appropriately changed.

While a space heating system remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating system is located to the remainder of the house and open a window a little.<p>
