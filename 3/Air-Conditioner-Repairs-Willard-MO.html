<h3>AC Service in Willard MO</h3>
<p>I have been using them for many years for my services, my own houses and my property clients' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is honest, trusted, and affordable on price. It's tough to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing money by not changing the older system.<p>
