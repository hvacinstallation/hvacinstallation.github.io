<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic.

He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful.
