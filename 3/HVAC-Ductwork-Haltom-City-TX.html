When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater.

<h3>Central Heating Installation Agency in Haltom City TX</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by using smart technology. Martin stated the company can develop a control panel within the structure's controls that will supply information on its systems to enable actual time visibility, supplying the ability to be preventative rather than reactionary. This service can be provided to any commercial customer, not just throughout new construction.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
