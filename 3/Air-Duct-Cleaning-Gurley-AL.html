<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
