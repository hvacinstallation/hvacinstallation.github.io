<h3>How To Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Cottage Hills IL</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present pattern in house construction is to decrease air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, floors, and roofs. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air assists and waters down indoor contaminants exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be properly vented and cleaned from the furnace routinely. Change the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned up due to the fact that the soot develops inside the ducts, lowering their effectiveness in time. Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
