<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
