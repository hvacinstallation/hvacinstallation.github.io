It doesn't take long to spend $500 just to keep an old oil or natural gas furnace running. Heaters incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair sign is whether you needed to wait to get parts replaced. As a furnace ages, it gets harder to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be really cold on a below zero night.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a referral later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
