For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>My oldest child always complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one.
