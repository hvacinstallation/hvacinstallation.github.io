<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by people and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
