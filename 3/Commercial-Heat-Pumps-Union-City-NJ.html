<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. When the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
