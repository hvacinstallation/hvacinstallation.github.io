<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
