<p>A specific a/c unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the same air path. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, considering that all components of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is actually heated, simply as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
