<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
