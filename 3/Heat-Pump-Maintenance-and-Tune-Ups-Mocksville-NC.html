<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is designed for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other specialists concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of building products, smoking, household items, and using unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating systems.

The choice to repair or replace depends on you, and typically it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, taking into account the age of the devices, versus the cost of a brand-new furnace that likely uses greater energy efficiency and includes warranty coverage.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window.

You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
