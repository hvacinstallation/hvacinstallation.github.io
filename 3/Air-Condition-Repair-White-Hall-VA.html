<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
