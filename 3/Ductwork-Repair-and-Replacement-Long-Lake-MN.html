<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
