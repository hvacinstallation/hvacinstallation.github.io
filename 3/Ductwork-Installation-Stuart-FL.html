<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Stuart FL</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

And if it's too small, you won't get warm or enough cool air to keep you comfortable.<p>
