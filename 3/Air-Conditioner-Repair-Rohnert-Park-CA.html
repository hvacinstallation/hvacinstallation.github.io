<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, rather than outdoor or industrial settings. In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It may also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to individual spaces.<p>

Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
