<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
