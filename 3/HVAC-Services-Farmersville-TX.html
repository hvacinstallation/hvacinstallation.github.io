<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
<h3>Indoor Air Conditioner in Farmersville TX</h3>
<p>A main factor in the avoidance of health symptoms is an efficient, appropriately designed and operating ventilation system. The ventilation system figures out the quality of the indoor air by managing the amount of air that is contributed to the office atmosphere, the cleanliness of such outside air, and the rate at which the workplace air and its toxins are either tired to the re-circulated or outside throughout the building.<p>
<p>Air flow patterns in structure are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Atmospheric pressure differences created by these forces move air-borne toxins from locations of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure through any available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move till the inside pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
<p>This handbook describes the WH-1. Active, direct systems. (See System Diagram). The Model Sun Ray WH-1. is an active, direct system.
