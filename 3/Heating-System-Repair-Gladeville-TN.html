<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil.
