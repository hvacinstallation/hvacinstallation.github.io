<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance products that only an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do.

Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are important to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the essential equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still essential to have a professional technician examine the system occasionally.<p>
