This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While space air conditioning offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is normally more pricey than central air.<p>
