<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
