<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
