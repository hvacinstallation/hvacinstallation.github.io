<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has become a crucial concern to homeowners and health specialists. Indoor air contamination research studies have determined numerous pollutants that can be present in indoor air.

Proper ventilation and removal of the sources of these impurities are essential in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
