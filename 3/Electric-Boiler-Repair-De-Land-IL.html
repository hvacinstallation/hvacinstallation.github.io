A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of a number of rooms with one external unit.

<p>The very first air conditioners and refrigerators used poisonous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might result in deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials.

All of these products are little particles, can become airborne, and hence, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
