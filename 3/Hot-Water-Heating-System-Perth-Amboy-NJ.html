<p>In a lot of cases, if products have stopped working to dry numerous days after the presumed water occasion, mold development is suspected within wall cavities even if it is not right away visible. Through a mold investigation, which may include harmful inspection, one should have the ability to identify the existence or absence of mold. In a situation where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality may have been compromised, mold removal might be needed. Mold testing and inspections must be carried out by an independent detective to avoid any conflict of interest and to guarantee accurate results; free mold testing provided by removal companies is not recommended.<p>
