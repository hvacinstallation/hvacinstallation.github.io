<p>Air contaminants can range from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your animals to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air contaminant resulting from gas that leaves into your house without being burnt. Older houses might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In bathrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where wetness levels are normally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is often vital to determining the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such information can sometimes be gotten by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If monitoring data is not readily available, yet a high variety of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent should request that the employer have air tracking tests conducted. Review of this data might recognize possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of information may not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
