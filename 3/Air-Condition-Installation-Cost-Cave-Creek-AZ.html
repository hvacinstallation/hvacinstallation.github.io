<p>Central air is a high-end not everyone can pay for, so many Seattleites should discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in huge box shops like Best Buy, package fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the truth of a terrible, vicious summertime.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the US your house lies, the local region's climate can change considerably.
