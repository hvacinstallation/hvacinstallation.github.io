<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
