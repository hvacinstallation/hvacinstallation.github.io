<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC specialists like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that come with owning a high-demand, seasonal business. A carefully crafted service plan for an HVAC company is the first step to handle those lulls and peaks so your revenues stay healthy year-round.

The greater the system's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all home appliances.<p>
