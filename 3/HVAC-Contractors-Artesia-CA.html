<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad.
