<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary ac system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
