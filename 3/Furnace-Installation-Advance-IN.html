<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heating systems have multiple control panel. The biggest, or only one in some heaters, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the brand-new control panel must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t correctly identified, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a professional to identify.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the problem, all the while discussing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
