<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has seen the single-family house installation service totally turn on its head the last couple of years.

It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with newcomers more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle property owners are lastly giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
