<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
