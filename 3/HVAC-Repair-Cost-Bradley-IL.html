<p>Many individuals underestimate the extent of the indoor air contamination issue. Air contamination is normally imagined as the black smoke released from factories. Little thought is offered to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, cleaners, pesticides, and paints used in the house.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to offer auto debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
