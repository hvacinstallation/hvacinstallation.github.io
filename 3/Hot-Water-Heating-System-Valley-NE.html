<p>A packaged system, normally installed on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an option for house owners to consider. Often times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those looking to save money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, considering that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are usually only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more pricey than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best option for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
