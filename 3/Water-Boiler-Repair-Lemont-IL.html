<p>If it's time to update an aging AC, variable speed is the way to go. Already preparing to replace an existing air conditioner? Assuming your spending plan accommodates a variable speed system, you must absolutely get one!

<p>We suggest using our insulation boards when setting up over concrete pieces. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash when used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely efficient thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of allowing heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
