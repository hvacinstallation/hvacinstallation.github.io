<p>We needed two gos to - Jake came out first and was really educated and pleasant and polite. Grant came out a couple days later on and was great and likewise knowledgeable to talk to. They both did a fantastic job. Sabre's workplace personnel is very valuable, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and offering the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are also well priced for their services. Certainly recommend.<p>
<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
