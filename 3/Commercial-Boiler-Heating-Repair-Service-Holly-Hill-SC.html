The team took the whole day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We picked getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility costs. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
