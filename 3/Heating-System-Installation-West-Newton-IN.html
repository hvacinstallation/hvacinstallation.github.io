"Humidifier fever" is a common health problem triggered by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Different fungi and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these impurities can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological impurities are family pets and family plants.<p>
<p>When mounting a wall sensing unit, consider the height at which they must be positioned. Most commonly they are installed at height-level or a little lower, if individuals mostly stay seated in that specific area.
