<h3>Direct Purchase HVAC Equipment at Hampstead NH</h3>
<p>Even newer heating systems less than five years of ages have actually been discovered as bad.

The Efficiency Check-Up (see previous response above) is also essential to your furnace's life span.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the job and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to properly service and the system has been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
