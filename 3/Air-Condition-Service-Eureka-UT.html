<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from processes or items; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is frequently important to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such information can sometimes be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If keeping an eye on data is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative ought to request that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this data may recognize potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when impurity concentrations are very low, monitoring information may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
