Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Shut off the power. Flip the a/c service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work appropriately after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC will not work fully unless you do this.<p>
