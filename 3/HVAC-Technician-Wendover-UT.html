<p>The very first air conditioning system and refrigerators utilized flammable or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Among the disadvantages of central heating is that it's possibly expensive to install, especially in an older home. Depending upon the type of system installed, it can be loud and cause problems if you're highly allergic to dust. Furthermore, specific fuels and equipment may need special licenses, and there is limited versatility in the event of changed heating requirements. During use, there is a time delay while heat is being transported from the heating unit to the living space.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
