<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Pine Valley UT</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his examination, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
