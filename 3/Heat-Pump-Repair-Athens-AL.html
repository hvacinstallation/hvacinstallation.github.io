<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can become blocked with particles that can limit air flow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Dirty filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to close down entirely. By contrast, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can generally be carried out in just a couple of minutes, typically without any tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
