<h3>How To Pick An HVAC Company in Atwood CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
