<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical product gradually. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
