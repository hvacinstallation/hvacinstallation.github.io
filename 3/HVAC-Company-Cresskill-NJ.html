<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate terrific however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
