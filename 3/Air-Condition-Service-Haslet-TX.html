<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Haslet TX Home</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will require to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
