In a contained system like a house, the warmer objects naturally heat the cooler ones until a balance is accomplished.<p>
<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably lowers direct exposure to toxins during cooking. Incorrect change, typically suggested by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you buy a brand-new gas stove or variety, consider buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot burner that burns continually. Never use a gas range to heat your house. When the fireplace is in usage, constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
