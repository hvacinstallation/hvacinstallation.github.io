A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator requires handled by professionals, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
