<p>All houses need reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the right temperature level. Heaters that kick on often might be due to an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the conventional water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. If the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank, it is likely that it is supported by the plumbing. Set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced.<p>
