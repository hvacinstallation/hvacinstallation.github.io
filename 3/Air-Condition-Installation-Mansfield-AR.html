<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a distribution system. Metal pipes are seldom utilized due to long-term destructive concerns.
