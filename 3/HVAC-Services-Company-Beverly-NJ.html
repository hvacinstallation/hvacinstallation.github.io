<p>We're spending a lot more time indoors, these days. While lots of people assume pollution is simply an outside problem, your house (and workplace) can also be polluted. As a society, we ensure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we don't believe adequate about direct exposure to all the things we put in our homes," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a huge effect on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- immediately, they can begin years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

If the marketplace for that energy source turns unpredictable, rates can fluctuate, prices spike and you can wind up paying more to heat your home regardless of how low you set your thermostat.<p>

<p>Both need to be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil.
