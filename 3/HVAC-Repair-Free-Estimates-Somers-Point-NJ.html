<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
