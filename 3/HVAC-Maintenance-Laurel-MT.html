<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source.
