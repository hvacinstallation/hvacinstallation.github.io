<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.
