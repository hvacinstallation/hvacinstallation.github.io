<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
