<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up just a couple of years earlier.<p>
