<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it extremely rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
