<h3>Heating Tips For Gas Home Furnaces in Clarksville AR</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor system rather of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
