<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, location 2 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, considering that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
