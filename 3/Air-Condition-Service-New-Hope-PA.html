<h3>Heating And Cooling Repair in New Hope PA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
