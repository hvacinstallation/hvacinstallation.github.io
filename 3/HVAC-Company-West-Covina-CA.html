<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
