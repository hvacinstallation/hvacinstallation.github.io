<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated hold-up features. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
