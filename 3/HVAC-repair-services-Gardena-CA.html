<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a few parts that were going out.

I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was extremely happy they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>
