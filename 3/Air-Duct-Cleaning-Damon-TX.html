<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, but it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative influence on occupants-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
