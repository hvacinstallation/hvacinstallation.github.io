<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller home, which will impact installation costs. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>The ability of organic chemicals to cause health effects varies greatly, from those that are highly poisonous, to those without any known health effect. Similar to other contaminants, the extent and nature of the health result will depend upon many factors consisting of level of exposure and length of time exposed. Eye and breathing tract inflammation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders, and memory impairment are among the immediate symptoms that some individuals have actually experienced soon after exposure to some organics. At present, not much is known about what health effects happen from the levels of organics generally discovered in homes. Many natural compounds are known to trigger cancer in animals; some are presumed of causing, or are understood to trigger, cancer in humans.<p>
