<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
