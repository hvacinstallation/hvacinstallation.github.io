<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Many typical building materials utilized prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Generally, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the structure products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure remodelling. Because the fibers can be spread out into the air during the removal process, elimination of asbestos-containing products is not always optimum. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is typically advised instead.<p>
