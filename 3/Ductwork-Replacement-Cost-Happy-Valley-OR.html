<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

Relying on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a house can be warmed in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found just a couple of feet listed below ground. In the summertime, the process reverses, therefore cooling a house by eliminating heat. Underground temperature level remains continuous no matter the environment, so geothermal systems supply consistent and trustworthy heating and cooling.<p>
