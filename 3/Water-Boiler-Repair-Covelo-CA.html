<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you should inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
