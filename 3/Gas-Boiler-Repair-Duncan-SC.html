<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
