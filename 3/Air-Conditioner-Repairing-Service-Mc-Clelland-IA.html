<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
