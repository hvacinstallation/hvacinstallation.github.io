<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Kempton IL</h3>
<p>Even newer heaters less than 5 years old have been found as bad. A lot of property owners are shocked to learn that their 'new' furnace  heat exchanger. Sometimes it is due to bad furnace design, however in a lot of cases, it's from neglect.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
