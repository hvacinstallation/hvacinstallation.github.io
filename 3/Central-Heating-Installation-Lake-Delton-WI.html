<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
