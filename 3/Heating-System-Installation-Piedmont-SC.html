<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
