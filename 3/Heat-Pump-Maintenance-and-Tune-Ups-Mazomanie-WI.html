<p>Trace was the service technician that took care of my semi annual maintenance today. Trace was on time, considerate, and appreciated my house by constantly wearing boot coverings when entering my home. He showed the points of inspection and likewise suggested I have a UV light set up due to a small accumulation of mold collecting in the air handler, which he thoroughly cleaned the exterior and inspected compressor coils as well as ensured the wetness discharge tube was clear by using a cleaning liquid and a store vacuum. He also got rid of the leaves that accumulated inside the interior of the compressor system and advised a service to avoid it from continuing, which will do.I received a detailed e-mail report of the evaluation laying out all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is an asset to Waychoff's and I highly suggest him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
