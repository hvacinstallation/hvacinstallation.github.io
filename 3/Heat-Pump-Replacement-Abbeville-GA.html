Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues.

While a space heater remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heater is located to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
