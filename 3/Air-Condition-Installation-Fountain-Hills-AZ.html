<p>Don't panic! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it simply may need 24 volts of electrical power. The Nest thermostat needs 24 volts of low voltage supplied by your transformer to keep the digital display screen on. If 24 volts isn't gotten, you'll get a blank screen. There are various reasons your Nest appears dead or has a blank screen. We'll be discussing why you might be having problem with your Nest smart thermostat. Check your emergency breakers first. You must have the right amount of high voltage going to your furnace. Inspect if you have the appropriate 120 volts of power going to the furnace.
