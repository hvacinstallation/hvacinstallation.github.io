<h3>AC Maintenance in Tranquillity CA</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
