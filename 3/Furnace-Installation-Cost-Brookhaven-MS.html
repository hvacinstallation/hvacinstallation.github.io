<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
