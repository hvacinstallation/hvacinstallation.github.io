The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to correctly service and the system has actually been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
