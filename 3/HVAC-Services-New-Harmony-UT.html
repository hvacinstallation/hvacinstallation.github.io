Some sources, such as constructing materials, home furnishings and products like air fresheners, can release contaminants basically constantly.

In a typical air-conditioned house, cooling consumes more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy per year, causing power plants to produce about 3,500 pounds of co2 and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 should be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements utilized for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be necessary.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
