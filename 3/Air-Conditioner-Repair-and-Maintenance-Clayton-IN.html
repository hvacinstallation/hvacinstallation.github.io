<p>Installation involves digging long trenches or deep holes to install the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll conserve cash over the long term because of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as traditional air-source systems. The absence of moving parts indicates you're less most likely to invest huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're considerably more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
