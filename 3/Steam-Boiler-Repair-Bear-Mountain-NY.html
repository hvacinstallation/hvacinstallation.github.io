<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
