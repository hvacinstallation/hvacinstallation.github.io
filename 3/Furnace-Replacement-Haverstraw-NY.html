<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
