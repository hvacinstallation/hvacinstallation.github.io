<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain harmful substances (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible for the most part, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the launched spores.

<h3>Selecting Commercial HVAC Repair Services at New Rochelle NY</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various home efficiency upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.)
