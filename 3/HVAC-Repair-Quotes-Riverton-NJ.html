The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure.

All the damp hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then eliminated from the area that is being cooled. If your HVAC system is not draining pipes appropriately, you'll have a water leakage. A limitation in your drain pipelines triggers a water leak. There are various locations a clog can happen. One of the primary locations where blockages begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
