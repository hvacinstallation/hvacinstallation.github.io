<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had actually found the problem area in examining the costs. He dealt with the concern in one day, had actually changed the bill to what I thought about fair before he called back, understood what might have triggered the problem and had a plan to insure that it would not take place once again. I have actually thought about All Points a company with stability for the 9 years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
