The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not use this.
