<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not use them.. Secondly like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the unit has actually been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
