<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have two different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioner into a heatpump While space cooling provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air.<p>
