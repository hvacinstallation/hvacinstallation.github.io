<p>The primary factor property owners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the quantity of services offered. If the system is new and still under a manufacturer's service warranty, the cost may not be rewarding. Any significant repairs should be covered under the producer's warranty. However, some manufacturers need routine maintenance as a term of the service warranty.<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that often, our nationally representative study discovered. Approximately 40 percent rarely or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned up or replaced their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
