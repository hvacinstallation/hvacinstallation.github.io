<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating unit, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room.

As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling.
