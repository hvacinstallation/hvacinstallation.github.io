<h3>AC Technician in Nellysford VA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Trane central air conditioning conditioners are known for supporting service warranties and offers a basic 10-year warranty that covers both parts and labor. A Trane XR14 that has a 14 SEER rating in energy efficiency would cost anywhere from $4,800 to $6,800 to set up. Trane products are often pricier than other HVAC brands, but as the old saying goes, You get what you spend for." Trane is thought about a premium brand name that offers outstanding air conditioners, heatpump, and gas furnaces.<p>
