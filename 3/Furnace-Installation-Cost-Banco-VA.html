<p>As many of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices maker's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in place. In addition, the concrete results of a PM is often tough to measure, as one response mentioned the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not just break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the outcome of repetitive use of a component that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature degeneration, resulting in holes and cracks. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the element.  a very beneficial result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
