<h3>Comparing Commercial Boilers into Residential Boilers at Lyman SC</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in house building is to lower air leak through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, floors, and walls. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
