<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to order it. My other half said that she had seen a terrific evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He provided to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent people I have actually satisfied in a long period of time.
