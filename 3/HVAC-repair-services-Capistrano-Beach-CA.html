An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing prior to work began.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash can be found in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to provide car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There must not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
