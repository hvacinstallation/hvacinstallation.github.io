<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. Often it's not a significant issue, and your system might simply require some maintenance work. It is unexpected how many people practice preventive maintenance on our vehicles, for example, but don't do the exact same thing for the system that keeps us warm in the winter season. Do not hesitate to ask about our service strategies that include preventive maintenance if you wish to stay ahead of any problems with your house or business HVAC system, so you can prevent costly repairs or replacements.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned regularly, they can end up being clogged with particles that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases cause the system to close down totally. By contrast, replacing a furnace and checking filter can usually be performed in just a couple of minutes, typically with no tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
