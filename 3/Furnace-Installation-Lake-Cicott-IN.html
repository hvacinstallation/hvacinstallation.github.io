<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not offer them.  Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the system has been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years.
