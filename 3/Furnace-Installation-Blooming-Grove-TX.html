<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from products or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

<p>Practically half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of as soon as a week, and 34 percent usage candle lights or incense that often, our nationally representative study discovered.

And almost 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
