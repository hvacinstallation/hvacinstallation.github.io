<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils.

It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like an area heating unit) with the same quantity of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
