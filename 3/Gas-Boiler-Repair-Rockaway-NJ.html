He dedicated to the job based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of affordable ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install assessment results look great for braising and plumbing quality.

<p>The condensate drain in your ac system and heat pump must be without all blockages and debris. Obstructions can block the flow of condensed water and cause moisture accumulation within the system. Excess moisture can cause issues like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the home, unequal temperature policy, germs, and compromised air quality. A professional maintenance technician will flush and clean up the condensate drain to make sure all excess wetness flows away from the system.<p>
