<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Verona VA</h3>
<p>MAINTENANCE PLANS: Your HVAC system is an investment that spends for itself throughout the years, but just if you safeguard it to the very best of your capability. Fortunately, this doesn't have to be a chore! When you sign up for a Keefe's maintenance strategy, we look after everything.

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

These investigations exposed that proper ventilation is important in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>
