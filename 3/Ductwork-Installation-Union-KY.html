<p>In addition, employee health symptoms such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, irritation, and irregular breathing might be caused as the outcome of temperature level extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and too much or too little air flow. Work environment temperature levels need to be kept between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by too much air circulation must be prevented.<p>
<p>Typically the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
