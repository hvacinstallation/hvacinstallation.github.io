<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
