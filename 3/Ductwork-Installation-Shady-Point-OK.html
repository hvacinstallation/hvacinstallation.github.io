<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair at Shady Point OK</h3>
<p>First, unlike central air conditioning, you have a couple of choices when it comes to central heating systems.

<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
