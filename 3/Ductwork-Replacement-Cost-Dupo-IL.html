Load determining is referred to as the Manual J computation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or system cost for cooling. If your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you require based upon experience or on square video alone, transfer to another contractor. Just like measuring the size of a system needed based on BTUs, figuring out the proper size of system for your house also depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outside metal cabinet includes the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator. In lots of split-system air conditioning unit, this indoor cabinet likewise includes a furnace or the indoor part of a heatpump.
