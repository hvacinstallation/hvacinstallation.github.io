<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Stability Energy fasted to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two furnaces were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced 2 furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the new heating systems can heat your house. Truthfully, our home heating system is made complex, Rob and his team repaired the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
