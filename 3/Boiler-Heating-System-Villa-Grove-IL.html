<p>In addition, worker health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing may be caused as the result of temperature level extremes, incorrect humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation. Work environment temperature levels should be preserved in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts caused by excessive air circulation should be avoided.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can vary from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air toxin resulting from natural gas that gets away into your house without being burned off. Older houses may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchen areas and bathrooms, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where wetness levels are generally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
