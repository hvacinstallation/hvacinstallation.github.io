<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
