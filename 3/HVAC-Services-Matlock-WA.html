<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but your home does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
