<h3>The Benefits of Buying A New Furnace at Mansfield MO</h3>
<p>The types of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are as different as the different homes they serve (single family homes, duplexes, mobile houses, homes, high-rise condominiums, row housing, and so on). No matter what the type of house HVAC system, appropriate air flow (ventilation), proper filtration, and humidity manage all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will guarantee that it is running securely and not contributing to or causing an indoor air issue.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
