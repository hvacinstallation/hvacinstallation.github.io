<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could flatter two times the electrical power that even a low-end new one would use. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than devices set up simply a couple of years earlier.<p>
<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and detach block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan must spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins however the fan doesn't. Shut off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan starts. If  it doesn't, you have actually provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
