<p>Specialist heater installations. However, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually stop working. HVAC experts advise following this fundamental guideline when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's finest to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>More typical in fairly older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electricity, oil or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in individual spaces.

Newer gas boilers must achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
