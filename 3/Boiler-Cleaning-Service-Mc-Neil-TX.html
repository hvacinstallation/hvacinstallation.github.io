<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, many of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up routinely, they can end up being clogged with debris that can restrict airflow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's effectiveness.

By comparison, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can typically be performed in just a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
