<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and effectively, but to have 2 major components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>There's a big distinction in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical type of home heating-- convection. Over the past century, the majority of homes in chillier climates were heated by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the floors, ceilings and walls heated up. In turn, the things in the space, like furniture and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
