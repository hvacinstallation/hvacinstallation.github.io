<p>In houses, the most considerable sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pushed wood products made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products made for indoor usage consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiberboard includes a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood item and is generally recognized as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood product.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>

Meanwhile, in big box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens.
