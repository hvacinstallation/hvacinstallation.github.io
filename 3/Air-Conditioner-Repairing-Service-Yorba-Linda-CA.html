The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

The parts we utilize are backed up with a two-year parts guarantee when we do any repair.
