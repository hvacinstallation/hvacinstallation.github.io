<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes.
