<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside system as near to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
