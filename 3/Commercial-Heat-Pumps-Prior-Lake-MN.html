<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 need to be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be needed.<p>
