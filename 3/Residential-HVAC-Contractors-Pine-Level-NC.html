<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ may notice musty or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
