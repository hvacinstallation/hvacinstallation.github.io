Due to the fact that a system is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>

The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most budget friendly. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
