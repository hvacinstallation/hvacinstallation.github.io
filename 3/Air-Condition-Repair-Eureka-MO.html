<p>We advise using our insulation boards when installing over concrete pieces. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by serving as an extremely efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of enabling heat to warm up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more difficult to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate.

The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
