<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same contaminants. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>

<p>Many people undervalue the extent of the indoor air pollution problem. Air pollution is typically envisioned as the black smoke given off from factories. Little idea is given to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, paints, cleaners, and pesticides utilized in the house. To intensify the issue, it is approximated that the average American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his or her time inside your home, and majority that time is invested in the house.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor environmental quality") describes how within air can affect an individual's comfort, health, and capability to work. It can include temperature level, humidity, lack of outside air (poor ventilation), mold from water damage, or direct exposure to other chemicals. Currently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements however it does offer standards about the most common IAQ workplace grievances.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to water down polluted (indoor) air. Local building regulations most likely specify the amount (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that should be continually provided in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation combined with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
