<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't produce heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen over time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
