<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
