Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step.
