Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
