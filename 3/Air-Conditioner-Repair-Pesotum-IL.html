<p>A hydronic radiant flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipelines set up under the flooring or right within the floor surface area itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other short articles with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and individuals. It does not rely on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to supply enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
