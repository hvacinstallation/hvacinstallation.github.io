<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace in Copeland FL</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
