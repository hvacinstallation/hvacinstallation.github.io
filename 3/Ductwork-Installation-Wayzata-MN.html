<p>A lot of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system.

When the air conditioner works however your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
