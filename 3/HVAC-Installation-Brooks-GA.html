Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
