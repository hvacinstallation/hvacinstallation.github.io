Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to offer sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
