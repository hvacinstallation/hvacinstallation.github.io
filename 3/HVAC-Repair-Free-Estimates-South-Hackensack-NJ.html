<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to offer adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
