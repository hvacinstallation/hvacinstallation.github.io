<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go someplace. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to offer adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
