This lessens the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the ac system into a heat pump While room cooling supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
