<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>A good location to begin is to compare your oil or natural gas furnace age to the nationwide average. The typical life span of heaters in houses today is between 16 and 20 years.

The majority of people prefer to replace their furnace as a planned home improvement instead of a panic replacement when your furnace is faltering or has currently normal lifespan of a warm air furnace will differ based upon its operating environment, that's why it is very important to have the system serviced routinely by a certified technician.
