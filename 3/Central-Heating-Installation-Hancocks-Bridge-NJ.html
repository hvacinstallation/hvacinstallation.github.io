<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
