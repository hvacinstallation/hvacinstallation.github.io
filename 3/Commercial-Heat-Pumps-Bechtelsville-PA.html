<p>Although commercial geothermal systems have remained in presence since the mid-90s, and the idea developed much earlier than that, its application in homes is still relatively brand-new.

Consult your state health or real estate department for ideas on which public firms or personal laboratories may be able to help check your home for lead in paint.

<p>While pollutant levels from private sources might not present a significant health danger by themselves, most homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution.

Luckily, there are actions that the majority of people can take both to lower the threat from existing sources and to prevent brand-new problems from happening. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to take actions that can decrease the level of indoor air pollution in your own home.<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 should not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's supply of water, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is used for producing power in the form of electrical power. The 2 operations use different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to accomplish its goals.<p>
