Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature level, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
