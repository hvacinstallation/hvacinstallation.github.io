<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heaters have multiple control boards. The biggest, or only one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board should be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t correctly detected, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
