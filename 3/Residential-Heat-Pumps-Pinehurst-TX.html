<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies.

However, much of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
