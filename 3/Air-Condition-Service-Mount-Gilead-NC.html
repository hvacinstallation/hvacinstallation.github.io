<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity professional at a big seller who asked not to be named since he did not have permission to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a team that routinely keeps an eye on energy consumption and temperatures in stores to save money on expenses (especially during the night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperature levels in the shops change outside of an acceptable variety that could prevent customers from shopping at the store.<p>

This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
