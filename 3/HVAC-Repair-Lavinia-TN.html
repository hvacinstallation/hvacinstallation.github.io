However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
