<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you must inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
