<h3>Commercial Heat Pumps in Honea Path SC</h3>
<p>I have been using them for several years for my services, my own houses and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is sincere, trusted, and reasonable on cost. It's hard to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
