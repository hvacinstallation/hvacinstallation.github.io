<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to use auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There ought to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
