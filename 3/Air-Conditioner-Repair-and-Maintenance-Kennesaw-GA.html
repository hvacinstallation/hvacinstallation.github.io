<p>Central air units are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
