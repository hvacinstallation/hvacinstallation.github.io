Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, during brand-new building (houses generally utilize between one and five lots). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.

This makes geothermal heating a reliable and available source of energy.<p>
