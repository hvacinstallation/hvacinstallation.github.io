The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the house.<p>

They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have a choice for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. When the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately solidify and cure-- typically 2 to 4 weeks.
