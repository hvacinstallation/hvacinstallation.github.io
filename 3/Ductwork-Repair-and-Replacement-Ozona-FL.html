<p>My oldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
