<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a recommendation later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
