<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered with a Islandton SC HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
