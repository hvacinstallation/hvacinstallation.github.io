<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the ac system into a heatpump While space cooling provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air.<p>

<p>At present, EPA does not suggest utilizing air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay items. Because they only partially eliminate the radon decay items and do not lessen the amount of radon going into the house, the efficiency of these devices is unpredictable. EPA prepares to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or could end up being, a trustworthy means of reducing the health risk from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides further details on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>This is especially notable, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>

This can lead to the capacity for considerable health problems.<p>
