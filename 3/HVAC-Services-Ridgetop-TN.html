We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an uncommonly high bill that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had called the service manager and left a message of issue.
