<h3>Commercial Boiler Heating Repair in Maryland Heights MO</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
