<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Morgan City LA?</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present pattern in house construction is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, floors, and roofing systems. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air assists and dilutes indoor contaminants exhaust them from the home.<p>

Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
