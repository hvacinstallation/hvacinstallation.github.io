<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power should not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, given that the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces might not have a really comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the overall power is not simple, because it considers not only the small power of the units, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
