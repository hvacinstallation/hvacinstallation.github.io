<p>Sean was very valuable. He is an extremely pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>

<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to decrease the amount of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, steps need to also be required to minimize pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, citizens must look out to the development of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization steps need to not be carried out till these problems have been fixed.<p>
