<p>Sean was very handy. He is a very enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems besides the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
