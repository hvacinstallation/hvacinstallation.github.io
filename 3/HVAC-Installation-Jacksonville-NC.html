<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps guys working. When a sales man comes to your house he exists to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and should not "require" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on.
