<h3>Air Condition Service in Bolinas CA</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<h3>The Way to Pick An HVAC Company at Bolinas CA</h3>
<p>Sean was very helpful. He is an extremely pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to buy additional things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which requires to be appropriately vented and cleaned up from the furnace regularly. Change the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned up due to the fact that the soot builds up inside the ducts, decreasing their performance with time. Anticipate to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
