<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
