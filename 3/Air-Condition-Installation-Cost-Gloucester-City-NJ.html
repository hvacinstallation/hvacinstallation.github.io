<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
