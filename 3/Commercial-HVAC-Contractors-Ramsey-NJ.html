<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large company in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, previously this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for three years prior to that.<p>
