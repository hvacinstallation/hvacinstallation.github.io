<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace professionals frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>In the middle of the winter, when the air is bone-bitingly cold, the last thing you desire is a heating unit that can't finish the job.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works however your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
