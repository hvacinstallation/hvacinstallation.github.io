<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
