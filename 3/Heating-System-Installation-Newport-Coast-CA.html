The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't provide off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur gradually since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work till you buy a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
