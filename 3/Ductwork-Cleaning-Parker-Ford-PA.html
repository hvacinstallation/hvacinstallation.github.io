<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>In homes, the most considerable sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood products made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood items made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furnishings); wood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiber board includes a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood product and is normally acknowledged as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood product.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors.
