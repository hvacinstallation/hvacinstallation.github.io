<p>Customer products that contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive eliminators, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to trigger cancer in animals.

<p>The majority of credible HVAC technicians will provide totally free estimates with an in-person service call.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Think about potential impacts of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit. Follow the producer's directions, especially guidelines on the proper fuel and keeping the heater properly changed. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is typically an indicator of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heater is in use, open a door from the space where the heating unit is located to the rest of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
