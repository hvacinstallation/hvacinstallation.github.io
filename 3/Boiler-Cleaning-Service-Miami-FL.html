<h3>Designing Tips for Central Heating Systems in Miami FL</h3>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
