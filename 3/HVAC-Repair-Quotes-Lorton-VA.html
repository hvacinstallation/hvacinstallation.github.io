<h3>Best Heat Pump in Lorton VA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
