<h3>Stop Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water at Olathe KS</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based just on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of affordable ones received. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install group was respectful of my home and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up assessment results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 system it changed (also Provider).<p>
