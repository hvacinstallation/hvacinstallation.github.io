<p>Info offered in this security guide is based upon existing clinical and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The standards do not need you to alter your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services need to still be offered for your home's systems. The "life expectancy" of a central air conditioner has to do with 15 to 20 years. Makers usually continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance agreements after the brand-new standard goes into result.<p>
<p>Occupational exposure limits use dose-response information which reveal the health impacts of repeated direct exposure to one specific chemical.

Often the treatment is merely getting rid of the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified. Not long after exposure to some indoor air toxins, symptoms of some illness such as asthma may appear, be intensified or worsened.<p>
<p>Consider buying an energy-efficient model if your air conditioner is old. Search for the ENERGY STAR ® and EnergyGuide labels - certified central systems are about 15% more effective than standard designs.
