You can find the ASHRAE (American Society of Refrigerating, air-conditioning and heating Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for acceptable air quality online.<p>

Dust and dirt consisting of contaminants and irritants can cover the air conditioning ductwork with time. Sometimes it should be removed to refresh the quality and boost of indoor air and improve the cooling.
