<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
