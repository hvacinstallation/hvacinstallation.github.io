If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably simple procedure. Installing a new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are including on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
