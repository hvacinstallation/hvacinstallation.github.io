While geothermal systems do use some electrical energy, they release far less greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating systems that need natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
