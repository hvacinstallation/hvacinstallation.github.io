<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Smyrna GA</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are incredibly efficient, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a consistent temperature. These systems can achieve a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only obtain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling effect.

<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
