<p>All houses need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the proper temperature. Heaters that kick on regularly might be due to an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>
