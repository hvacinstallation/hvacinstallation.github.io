<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown.

The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

Bioaerosols launched into the air can be dispersed throughout the home by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can trigger transmittable diseases such as Legionnaires' illness. They also can trigger allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
