<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not produce heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen over time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to suffice until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the issue, all the while explaining whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
