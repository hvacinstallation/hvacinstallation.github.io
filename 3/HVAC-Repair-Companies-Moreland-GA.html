<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the task based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few sensible ones received. Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install evaluation outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
