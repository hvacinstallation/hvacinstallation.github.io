<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power needs to not exceed the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the very same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Simply put, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not easy, since it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
