After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by lots of people.<p>
