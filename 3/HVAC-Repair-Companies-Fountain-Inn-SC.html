<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals utilized in the construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops need to be used with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices need to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove items of incomplete combustion.

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, but it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
