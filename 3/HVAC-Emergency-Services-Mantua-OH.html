<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have been shown to cause the health impacts discussed. Nevertheless, it is not always real that the results kept in mind occur at the pollutant concentration levels generally discovered in the house. In a lot of cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health impacts is too minimal to figure out the levels at which the listed results could happen.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is frequently important to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can in some cases be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking information from the company. If keeping an eye on data is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this data may determine possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are really low, keeping track of data might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
