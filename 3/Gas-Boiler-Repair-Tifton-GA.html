<p>I normally don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
