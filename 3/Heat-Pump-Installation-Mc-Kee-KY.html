<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. When the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly treat and harden-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
