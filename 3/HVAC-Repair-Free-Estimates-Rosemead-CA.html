<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have built-in delay functions. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>We look at clues before we provide advice to change rather than repair a heating unit. Among the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
