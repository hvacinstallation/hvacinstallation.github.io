<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
