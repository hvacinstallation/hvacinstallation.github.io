<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
