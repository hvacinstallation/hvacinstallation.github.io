<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around repairing the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
