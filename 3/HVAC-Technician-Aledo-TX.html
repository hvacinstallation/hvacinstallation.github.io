<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
