<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run since it simply takes more electricity to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
