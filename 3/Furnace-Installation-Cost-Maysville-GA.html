<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
