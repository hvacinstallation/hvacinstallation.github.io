The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
