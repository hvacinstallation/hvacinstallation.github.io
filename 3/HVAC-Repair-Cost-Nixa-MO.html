<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have problems.

Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
