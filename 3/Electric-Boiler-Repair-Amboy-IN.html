HVAC experts suggest following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a new system, it's finest to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than essential.<p>

<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they detected the problem and repaired very rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
