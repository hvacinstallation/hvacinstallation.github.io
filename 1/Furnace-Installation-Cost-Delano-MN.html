One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are required to withstand current, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>Strategy on spending a number of thousand dollars for the complete system if you are considering installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your house.
