<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for years.

<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Herndon VA</h3>
<p>Central air systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Velocity System because of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an extra $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne.
