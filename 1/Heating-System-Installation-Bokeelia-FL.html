<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat.

<p>Filters can get unclean easily, especially if you reside in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, debris, germs, and tidy the air. They are accountable for keeping the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and changed frequently, your HVAC system will ultimately stop carrying out as you expect it to. The heating and cooling will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will intensify. Examining and altering the air filters is one of the most important aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
