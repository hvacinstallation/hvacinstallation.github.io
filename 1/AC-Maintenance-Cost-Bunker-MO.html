<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide should be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements used for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>

<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 2 days might end up being a source for mold development and should be disposed of. Often there is a musty smell however mold can not be seen.

Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the wetness issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely clean the location using established health department recommendations.<p>
