<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
