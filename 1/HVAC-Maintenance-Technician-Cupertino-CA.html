<p>A third way to choose whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, try to find signs of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can suggest your house may not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or smelly air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other products end up being moldy. To find odors in your home, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether odors are obvious.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those processes consist of generating outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. If one or more of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
