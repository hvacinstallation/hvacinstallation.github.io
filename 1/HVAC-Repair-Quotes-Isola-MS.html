<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power ought to not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor system.

Put simply, the outside system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces might not have a very comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not easy, because it takes into account not only the small power of the systems, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>House heating systems are made complex systems that require the services of a contractor to install. While you can certainly acquire your furnace yourself, most contractors will not warranty the furnace or might not install it if you don't purchase it from them.

<p>You should always hire an expert to perform AC repair, for the same factor that you trust an expert plumber or electrician. You don't conduct repairs on your own pipes system, or replace your own electrical grid. The reasons that you don't do those things are obvious.

Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
