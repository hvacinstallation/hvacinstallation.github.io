An example of time control is arranging flooring waxing and removing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as developed. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the higher temperature levels sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to provide thermal convenience indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities generate mold growth and moisture indoors is associated with a higher frequency of resident breathing issues.<p>
