<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
