<p>I have been using them for years for my companies, my own houses and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is honest, dependable, and sensible on rate. It's difficult to find an honest AC man and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely comprehensive in explaining what services would be performed.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine components. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, visit Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
