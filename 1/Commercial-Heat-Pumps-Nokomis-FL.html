<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Nokomis FL</h3>
<p>The use of air filters can trap a few of the air toxins. The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable Energy section suggests that "Air Filtration must have a Minimum Effectiveness Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to minimize the amount of dust that reaches the wet coils.

<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Nokomis FL</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We picked getting something more expensive than a conventional water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
