<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become airborne, and therefore, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline allergen could bring on an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
