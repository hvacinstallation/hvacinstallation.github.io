<p>Compounding the noted health signs may be task tension. In part, due to various aspects of workplace automation, the most stressful components of office work are increasing.

<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become airborne, and therefore, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline allergen could bring on an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans use air fresheners at least once a week, and 34 percent usage candle lights or incense that regularly, our nationally representative study discovered. Roughly 40 percent seldom or never ever clean their humidifier or cooking area variety hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned or replaced their furnace filter.
