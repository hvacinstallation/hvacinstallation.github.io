The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air contamination among the leading 5 environmental health dangers to the public.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
