<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
