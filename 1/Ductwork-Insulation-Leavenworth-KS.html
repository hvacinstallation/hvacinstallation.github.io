<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>In many cases, if products have actually failed to dry numerous days after the believed water occasion, mold growth is suspected within wall cavities even if it is not instantly visible.

In a scenario where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality may have been compromised, mold remediation might be needed.
