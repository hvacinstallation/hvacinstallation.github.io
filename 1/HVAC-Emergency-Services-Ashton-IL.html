<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes most likely define the quantity (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that need to be continuously provided in your buildings, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation coupled with appropriate use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be useful in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
