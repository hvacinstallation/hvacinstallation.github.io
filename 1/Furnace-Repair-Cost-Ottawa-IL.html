<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace since it's the most common heater in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for performance. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a fairly simple procedure. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite costly.<p>
