<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 ought to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements used for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
<p>Generally the most reliable way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more affordable method to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later on in this area.<p>
<p>Changing your old furnace with a new, more efficient design can fight volatile energy rates, minimizing your heating expenses by up to 45%. Developments in heating innovation have caused systems that contaminate less, enhance comfort, and last longer. A twenty to thirty years of age furnace typically has an AFUE of about 65%. The most affordable efficiency permitted by law for new gas models is 78%, and there are various choices that achieve 98%, for near total efficiency.<p>
