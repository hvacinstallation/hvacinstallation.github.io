<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
