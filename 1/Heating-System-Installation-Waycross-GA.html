<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
