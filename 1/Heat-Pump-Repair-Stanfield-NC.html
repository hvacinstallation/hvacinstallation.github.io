He committed to the job based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of sensible ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex correctly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up team was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post install examination results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
