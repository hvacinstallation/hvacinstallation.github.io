<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Greenville TX</h3>
<p>The icing issue ends up being far more serious with lower outside temperature levels, so heatpump are typically installed in tandem with a more conventional type of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is utilized efficiently throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
