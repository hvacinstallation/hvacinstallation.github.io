Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
