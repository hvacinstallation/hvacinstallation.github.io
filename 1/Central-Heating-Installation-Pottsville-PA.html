HVAC experts suggest following this standard rule when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>

On the other hand, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>
