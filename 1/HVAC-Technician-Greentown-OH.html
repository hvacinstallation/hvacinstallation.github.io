<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Greentown OH</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
