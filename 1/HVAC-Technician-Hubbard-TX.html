<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Company in Hubbard</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Vital Company in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% efficiency or much better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which might be rated as low as 80% effectiveness, this can mean considerable cost savings in annual heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage heating systems increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioner unit that sits outside your home. Heat pumps run on electricity and work like air conditioning unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like an area heating unit) with the very same amount of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
