<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years back and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>By piping coolant directly into the smaller wall-mounted units, ductless splits allow you to prevent the need for a complete duct system like most other cooling systems require.
