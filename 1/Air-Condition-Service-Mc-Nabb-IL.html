<p>Utilizing a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly lowers direct exposure to pollutants during cooking. Inappropriate modification, typically shown by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue. If you acquire a new gas range or variety, consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot burner that burns continuously. Never ever utilize a gas range to heat your house. Constantly make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in use.<p>
