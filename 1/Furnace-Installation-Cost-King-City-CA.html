They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they needed to buy it. My other half stated that she had actually seen a great review for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow.
