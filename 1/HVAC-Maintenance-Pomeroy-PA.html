A ductless system has a built-in efficiency benefit because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Because they do not need any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Since a system is installed in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
