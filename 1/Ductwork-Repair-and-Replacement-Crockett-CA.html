<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
