<p>Aspects that can contribute to the development of biological pollutants are moist or damp building products (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and inadequately preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning system. "Humidifier fever" is a common health problem brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Numerous fungi and bacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these impurities can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the structure residents. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are pets and home plants.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your financial investment by only using the services of a licensed contractor or a certified agent from a company or merchant to do the installation.
