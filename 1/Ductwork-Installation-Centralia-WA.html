They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
