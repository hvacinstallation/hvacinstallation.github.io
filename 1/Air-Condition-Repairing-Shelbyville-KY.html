<p>The bureau projects 34 percent employment development for HVAC technicians in between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all occupations. A number of factors contribute to this, including the replacement and upgrade of older cooling systems to meet more stringent environmental guidelines.

So, make sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service plan which usually includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
