<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely practical in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to momentarily handle the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention.
