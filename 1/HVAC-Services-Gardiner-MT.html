<p>In addition to getting the big image" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be set up to supply threshold signals. If, for instance, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could establish your monitoring equipment to notify you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm.

<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is often important to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such information can often be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking information from the employer. If monitoring data is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative ought to ask for that the employer have air tracking tests carried out. Evaluation of this data may identify potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are very low, keeping track of information might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
