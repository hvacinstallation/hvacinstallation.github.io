They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to order it. My partner stated that she had seen a great review for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most decent individuals I have actually fulfilled in a long time.
