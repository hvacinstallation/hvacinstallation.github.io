As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate terrific however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
