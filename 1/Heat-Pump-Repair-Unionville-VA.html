<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems in Unionville VA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven. Screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler usually take place when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips. In most cases, the belt is poorly lined up or used and requires replacement. Follow the directions above under A/c unit Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's handbook.<p>

There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger.
