<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
