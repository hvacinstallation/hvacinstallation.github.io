<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. As soon as the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly cure and harden-- usually two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
