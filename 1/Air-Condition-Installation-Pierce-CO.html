Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. Just including refrigerant is not a solution if it leakages. A qualified technician must fix any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with two local companies for bids. While both were useful and helpful, Ballard Gas offered us a much better deal, for extraordinary service. Instead of a basic sales task, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heater and located methods we could have more even heat. He included these considerable but minor adjustments in his bid. We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump since of recent warmer summer seasons and for environmental factors.<p>
