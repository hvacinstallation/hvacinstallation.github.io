<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most effective heating sources in terms of environmental costs. Since the energy used to heat your house is drawn out straight from the ground, it safeguards the environment from harmful digging, fracking, or contaminants. Geothermal systems use compressor and evaporator systems similar to those used in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do utilize some electrical energy, they launch far less greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating systems that require gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
