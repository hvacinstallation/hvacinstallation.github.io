<p>New heating systems are substantially more efficient than those of ten or more years ago, cutting costs by as much as 30%. To get repair-free and lasting efficiency from your new system, proper installation is a necessity.

Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan starts. , if it does not, you've offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
