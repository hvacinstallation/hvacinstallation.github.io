<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't offer off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place over time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
