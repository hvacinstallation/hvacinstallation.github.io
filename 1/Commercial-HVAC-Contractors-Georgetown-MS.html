<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might go into nearby ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
