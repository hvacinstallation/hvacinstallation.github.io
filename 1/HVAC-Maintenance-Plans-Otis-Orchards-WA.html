<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
