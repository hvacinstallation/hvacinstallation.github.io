AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Photo 6).<p>

<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Gaffney SC</h3>
<p>While radon in water is not an issue in homes served by most public water products, it has been found in well water. If you have actually checked the air in your house and discovered a radon problem, and you have a well, call a lab licensed to determine radiation in water to have your water evaluated. Radon problems in water can be easily fixed. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.<p>
<p>There are a couple of possibilities to discuss short cycling in extremely cold weather. The most apparent is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the really low temperature levels. Often, the furnace will just run harder to maintain a warm environment for your home when the weather condition is very cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. If you need clarity on this issue, contact one of our technicians.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen with time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice up until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
