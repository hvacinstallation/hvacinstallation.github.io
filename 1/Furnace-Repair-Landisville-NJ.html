<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your home that perfect temperature level throughout the year.

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
