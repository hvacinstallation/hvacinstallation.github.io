<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
