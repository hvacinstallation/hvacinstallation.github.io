<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine components. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, check out Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
