<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
