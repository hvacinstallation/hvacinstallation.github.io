<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Matteson IL</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year.

Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the issue and repaired very rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
