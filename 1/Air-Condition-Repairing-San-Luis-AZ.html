<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
