<p>Great Product! Shipment was type of weird being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we dealt with problems. I would suggest this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
