<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Philadelphia MS</h3>
<p>Many people are aware that outside air pollution can affect their health, but indoor air pollution can likewise have substantial, damaging effect. EPA studies of human exposure to air pollutants indicate that indoor levels of contaminants might be 2 to five times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air pollution amongst the leading 5 environmental health risks to the general public.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
