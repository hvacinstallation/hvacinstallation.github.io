<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might observe moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
