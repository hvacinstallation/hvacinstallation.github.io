<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 significant components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
