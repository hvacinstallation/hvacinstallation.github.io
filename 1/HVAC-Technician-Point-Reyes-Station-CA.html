PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While room air conditioning supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
