<h3>Air Conditioning Contractors in Slater SC</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have been revealed to cause the health effects pointed out. Nevertheless, it is not always true that the impacts noted take place at the pollutant concentration levels normally found in the home. Oftentimes, our understanding of the pollutants and their health impacts is too limited to determine the levels at which the listed impacts could occur.<p>
<p>Air pollutants can vary from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air pollutant resulting from gas that escapes into your home without being burned off. Older homes might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In bathrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where moisture levels are generally greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
