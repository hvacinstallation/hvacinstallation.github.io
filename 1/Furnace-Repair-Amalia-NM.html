<p>The main factor house owners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the amount of services used. The cost might not be rewarding if the system is new and still under a manufacturer's guarantee. Any major repairs need to be covered under the producer's service warranty. Nevertheless, some manufacturers need regular maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by animals and people; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
