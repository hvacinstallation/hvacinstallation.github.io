<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the potential to adversely affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor ought to examine and, if essential, update the structure envelope. For example, he might seal gaps and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation might be a more efficient solution to your cooling issues than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>If your central air conditioner will not cool however you can hear it running, it might just need to be cleaned. Whether or not this is the reason for the problem, it's an excellent early treatment to attempt. Plan to do this on a reasonably warm day.

Keep in mind: Constantly switch off the power before cleaning the system.<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it might flatter twice the electrical power that even a low-end new one would utilize.

Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.
