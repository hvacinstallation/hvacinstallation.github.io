<p>Sean was very practical. He is an extremely pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues besides the blower motor.
