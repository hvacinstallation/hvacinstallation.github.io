<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the 2 must not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is used for generating power in the form of electricity. The two operations use various procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to achieve its objectives.<p>
