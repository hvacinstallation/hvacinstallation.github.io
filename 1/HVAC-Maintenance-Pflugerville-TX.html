<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very delighted that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to check the air conditioning system before you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC systems even in winter season. We want we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>

Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
