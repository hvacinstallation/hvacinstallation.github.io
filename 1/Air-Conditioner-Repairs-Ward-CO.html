<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
