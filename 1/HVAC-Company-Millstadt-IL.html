<p>The icing issue becomes a lot more extreme with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more standard type of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used rather of the heatpump during harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heatpump is used efficiently during the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>There's a big difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical kind of home heating-- convection. Over the previous century, the majority of houses in cooler environments were heated by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the procedure of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the floors, ceilings and walls heated up. In turn, the items in the room, like furnishings and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
