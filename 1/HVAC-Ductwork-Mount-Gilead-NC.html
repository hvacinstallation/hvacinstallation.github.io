Their techs are professional and really educated. Expenses are sensible. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser today. Due to the fact that the cost was undoubtedly sensible, I did not trouble to get competitor's quotes due to the fact that of my trust in Waychoff.<p>
<p>Both must be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
