EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, offers more details on air-cleaning gadgets to lower indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
