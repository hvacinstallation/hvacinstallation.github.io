<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps at North Salem NH</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
