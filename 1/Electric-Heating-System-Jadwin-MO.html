<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives typically total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial cost of a system competitive with standard equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout new building and construction (homes typically utilize between one and five lots). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. Nevertheless, new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to traditional systems under the right conditions.<p>

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists if no impurity sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Since an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
