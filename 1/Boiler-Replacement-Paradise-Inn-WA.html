<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that secure your cooling system from flooding. One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great possibility; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency security switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on uncommon events.<p>
