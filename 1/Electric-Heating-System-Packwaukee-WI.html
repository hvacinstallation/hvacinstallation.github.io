Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the higher temperatures sometimes utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to supply thermal comfort inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold growth and moisture inside your home is connected with a greater prevalence of resident breathing issues.<p>
