<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
