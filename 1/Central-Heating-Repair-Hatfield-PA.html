<p>All cooling contractors should start their evaluation of your home by carrying out an A/c Contractors of America Manual J load computation. This determines the heat get your house is subject to. The computation is relatively simple to carry out and will expose what size unit you need. If the one you're thinking about desires to determine the right system for your house exclusively on experience, move on to another contractor. Though strongly affected by where you live, a number of factors affect the size system required, including the quantity of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and placement of doors and windows; and the orientation of your house to the sun.

If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was 6 months before the existing one ended.
