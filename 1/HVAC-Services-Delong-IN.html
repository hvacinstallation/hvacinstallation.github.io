Not all heating systems benefit all homes, and there are a number of factors that definitely need to be considered before picking one.

<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning an organisation was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't the end goal.
