<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works at Anguilla MS?</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics lately, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the unit sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
