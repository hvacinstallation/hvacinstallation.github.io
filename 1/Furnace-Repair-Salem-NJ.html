<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
