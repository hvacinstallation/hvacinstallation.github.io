According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins.

The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
