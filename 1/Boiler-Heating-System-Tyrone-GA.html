<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
