<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality.
