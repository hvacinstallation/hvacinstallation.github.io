<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
