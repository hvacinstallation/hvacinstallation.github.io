These systems can attain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling effect. A lot of ground source heatpump have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0.

We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material with time.
