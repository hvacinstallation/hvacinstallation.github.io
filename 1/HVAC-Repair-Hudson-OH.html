In an included system like a house, the warmer items naturally heat the cooler ones up until a balance is achieved.<p>
<p>If you discover a decrease in heat output, first ensure the air filter is clean and in excellent condition. Next, inspect other parts of the furnace for any accumulation of dirt, debris and dust, an economical repair that can help increase efficiency. Also, examine the vents and ducts for obstruction.

You might also need to examine your insulation to ensure that warm air does not leave from your area through various openings.<p>
