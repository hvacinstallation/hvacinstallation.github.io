<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as vital as a regular oil change in your vehicle. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. Throughout high use months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
