<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace.

If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively straightforward procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are including on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
