<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The purpose of many building ventilation systems is to generate sufficient fresh air for resident convenience while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing safety at reasonable energy expenses. Load calculating is referred to as the Manual J calculation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or system cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square video footage alone.
