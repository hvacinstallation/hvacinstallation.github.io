<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
