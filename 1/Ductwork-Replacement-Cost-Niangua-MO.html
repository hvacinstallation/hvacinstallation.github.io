Every maintenance job may require completely different steps and processes than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being inspected.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
