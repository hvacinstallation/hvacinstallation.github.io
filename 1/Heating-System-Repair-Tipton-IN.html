A filthy filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<h3>Benefits of Expert AC Repair in Tipton IN</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air helps and dilutes indoor contaminants tire them from the home.<p>
