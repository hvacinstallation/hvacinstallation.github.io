<p>Similar to most house improvement projects, the cost of a complete central heating system can vary widely based upon the size of the house. Many heating systems will last in between 15 and 20 years. In choosing a furnace, homeowner should think about heat output and performance.

A little home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too quickly and turn off for too long, leading to irregular temperature levels.<p>
