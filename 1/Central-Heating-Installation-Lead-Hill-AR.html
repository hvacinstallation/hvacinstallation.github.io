<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were excellent! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my needs entirely by providing an expert quote with options, without pushing additional items. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The likewise promptly followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home residents. Unlike other kinds of a/c unit, evaporative coolers depend on the outdoors air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be enabled to press the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to maintain and understand.<p>
