<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
