<h3>HVAC System in La France SC</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
