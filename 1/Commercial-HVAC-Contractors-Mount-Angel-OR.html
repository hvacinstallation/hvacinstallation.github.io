<p>Last week, Target told reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the preliminary invasion into its systems was traced back to network qualifications that were taken from a 3rd party vendor. Sources now inform KrebsOnSecurity that the supplier in question was a heating, air and refrigeration  conditioning subcontractor that has worked at a variety of locations at Target and other top sellers.<p>
<p>Iâ $ m actually particular with my things. I like my equipment and appliances original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs. So buying this ac system to replace my old one was rather of a challenging reality. You canâ $ t trust the commercial these days. Am grateful I got this though because it has restored my faith in good production. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this new Carrier I got since I purchased it 7 months ago. Itâ $ s just ideal.<p>
