<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
