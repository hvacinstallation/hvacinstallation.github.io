The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation.
