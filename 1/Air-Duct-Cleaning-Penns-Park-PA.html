From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some standard maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne toxins streaming through your system.

<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't provide off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off.
