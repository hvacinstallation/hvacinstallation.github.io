<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Ruthville VA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
