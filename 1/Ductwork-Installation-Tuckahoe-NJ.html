<p>There are a few possibilities to explain brief biking in extremely cold weather. The most apparent is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the very low temperatures. In some cases, the furnace will just run harder to maintain a warm environment for your house when the weather is very cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. If you require clarity on this issue, contact one of our service technicians.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside your home and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
