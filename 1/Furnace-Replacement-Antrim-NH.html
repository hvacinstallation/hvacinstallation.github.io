<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
