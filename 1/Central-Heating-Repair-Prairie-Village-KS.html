<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
