<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ issue. Your company should check measurements of temperature level, humidity and air flow. In addition, inspection and screening of the ventilation, heating and cooling systems (to make certain it is working according to requirements for constructing use and tenancy) need to be carried out. A structure walk-through to check for smells and search for water damage, leaks, dirt or bug droppings may be practical. Leakages require to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c systems, on roofs and in boiler pans can become contaminated with germs or fungis and need to be removed, also.

For example, in schools asbestos requires to be examined every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>
