Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions.

Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later in this section.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, typically described as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, floorings, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning system to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
