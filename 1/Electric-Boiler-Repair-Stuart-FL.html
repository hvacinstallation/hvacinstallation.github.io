<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other costs before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning an organisation was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't the end objective.
