<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
