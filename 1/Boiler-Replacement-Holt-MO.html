<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit.

However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
