<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
