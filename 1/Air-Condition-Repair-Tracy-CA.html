<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more troubles, since a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
