<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
