<p>At present, EPA does not suggest using air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay items. The effectiveness of these gadgets is uncertain because they only partially remove the radon decay items and do not decrease the quantity of radon getting in the house.

EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, supplies additional details on air-cleaning devices to reduce indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have been shown to cause the health effects discussed. Nevertheless, it is not always true that the impacts kept in mind happen at the pollutant concentration levels usually found in the home. Oftentimes, our understanding of the contaminants and their health effects is too limited to figure out the levels at which the listed impacts could happen.<p>
