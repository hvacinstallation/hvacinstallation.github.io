<p>The ability of natural chemicals to cause health impacts differs considerably, from those that are extremely poisonous, to those with no recognized health effect. As with other toxins, the extent and nature of the health result will depend upon many elements including level of direct exposure and length of time exposed. Eye and respiratory system inflammation, headaches, lightheadedness, visual conditions, and memory disability are among the immediate signs that some people have experienced soon after exposure to some organics.

<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has actually been used commonly in a variety of structure construction materials for insulation and as a fire-retardant. EPA and CPSC have banned a number of asbestos items. Manufacturers have also voluntarily restricted uses of asbestos. Today, asbestos is most typically found in older houses, in pipe and furnace insulation materials, asbestos shingles, millboard, textured paints and other finish materials, and floor tiles.<p>
<p>Some health results might show up soon after a single exposure or repeated exposures to a contaminant. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant impacts are treatable and usually short-term. Often the treatment is just eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified. Right after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins, symptoms of some diseases such as asthma may appear, be aggravated or aggravated.<p>
<p>Most HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that enable property owners to control the temperature level and set it on a schedule. For instance, you can set the thermostat to reduce the heat when you're not in home to conserve cash on the energy costs and make sure the system isn't overloaded. An expert technician will check the thermostat during the annual maintenance to make sure the actual temperature level and the temperature on the thermostat matches. If there's a difference in the temperature level, the technician needs to examine the thermostat's performance or evaluate the whole HVAC system.<p>

<p>A health questionnaire need to be developed and dispersed to all concerned workers. Such a tool needs to determine the variety of individuals impacted; specify ages and task descriptions of involved employees; determine where they lie within the workplace; indicate when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and time of year); offer a list of specific health signs or health problems; recognize all makers operated in the office; suggest the type of outside air contamination; and recognize prospective sources of task stress.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. With time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ may notice undesirable or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems.
