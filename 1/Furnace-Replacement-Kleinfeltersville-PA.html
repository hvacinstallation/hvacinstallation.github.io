<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace specialists typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, as well as all other kinds of heatpump, have actually efficiencies rated according to their coefficient of efficiency, or POLICE. It's a scientific way of figuring out how much energy the system moves versus how much it uses. The majority of geothermal heatpump systems have Police officers of 3.0 to 5.0. This implies for every unit of energy utilized to power the system, 3 to 5 units are provided as heat.<p>
