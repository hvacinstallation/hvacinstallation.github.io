<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains, and sumps. When radon becomes caught in concentrations and buildings develop indoors, exposure to radon ends up being an issue.<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your car. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. During high usage months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>
