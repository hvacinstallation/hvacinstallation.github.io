<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, since a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
