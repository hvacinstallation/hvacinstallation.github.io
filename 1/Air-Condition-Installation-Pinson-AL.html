<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All items in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature level after the radiant heat system has actually been operating for a while, consisting of people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that abrupt shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>

<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is permitted to increase and stream out high building openings to the outside (stack impact ), triggering cool outdoors air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation plans can use very little energy, but care should be taken to ensure comfort. In humid or warm environments, preserving thermal comfort solely by means of natural ventilation may not be possible. Air conditioning systems are used, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers likewise utilize outside air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outside air when proper.<p>
