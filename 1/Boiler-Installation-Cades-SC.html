<p>All modern a/c systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
