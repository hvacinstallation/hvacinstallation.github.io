<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
