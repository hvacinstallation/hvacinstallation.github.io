<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
