<p>You're motivating the development of mold in wet air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, preventing mold development and contamination. Obviously, too-dry air can also irritate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the development of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health.

They are accountable for preserving the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and changed frequently, your HVAC system will eventually stop carrying out as you anticipate it to.
