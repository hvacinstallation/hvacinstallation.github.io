<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
