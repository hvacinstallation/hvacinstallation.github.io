<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants. In other words, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>Location the solar storage tank near the conventional water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, ensure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are accessible. It is likely that it is supported by the pipes if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>

These limitations may not be appropriate in office settings or for the house.<p>
