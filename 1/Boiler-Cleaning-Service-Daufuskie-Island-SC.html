<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ may see musty or undesirable smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
