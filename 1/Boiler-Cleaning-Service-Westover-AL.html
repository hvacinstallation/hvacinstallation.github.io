<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
