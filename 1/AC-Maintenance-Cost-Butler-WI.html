<p>I am really amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years earlier and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>

The impacts of CO direct exposure can vary significantly from individual to individual depending upon age, overall health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
