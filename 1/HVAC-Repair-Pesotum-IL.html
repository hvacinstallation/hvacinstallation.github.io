They will try to find signs of corrosion, leakages, and back draft and repair the problem throughout their maintenance runs.<p>

<p>The predominant health result associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
