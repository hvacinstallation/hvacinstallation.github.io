<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
