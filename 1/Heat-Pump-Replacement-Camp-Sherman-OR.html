<p>The function of the majority of building ventilation systems is to generate sufficient fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing security at sensible energy costs. Load calculating is described as the Handbook J computation and ought to be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or system cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square footage alone. Similar to measuring the size of an unit required based upon BTUs, determining the correct size of unit for your home also depends on the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Choosing the best size central air system for your house is extremely important, as is selecting either a plan system, which keeps condenser, fan and coil all in one system, or a split system, which places the condenser outside the home and the fan and coil inside.
