For over 25 years, Ballard Natural Gas Service has offered the greatest quality services for your house. You can bask in knowing that we will treat your air conditioner, furnace, water heater, ducts, or gas fireplace the very same method we would treat our own-- with the best care and greatest quality professionalism.<p>
<p>We look at hints before we offer suggestions to replace rather than repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>

And almost 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
