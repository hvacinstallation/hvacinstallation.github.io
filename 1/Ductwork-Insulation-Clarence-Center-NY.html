Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
