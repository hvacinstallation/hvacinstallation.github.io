<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
