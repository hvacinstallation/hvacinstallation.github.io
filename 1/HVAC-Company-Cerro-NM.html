<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heater, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by distributing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
