<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heater, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by distributing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room.

As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
