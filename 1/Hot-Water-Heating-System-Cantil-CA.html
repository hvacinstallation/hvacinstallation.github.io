<p>It's a reality that a brand-new furnace for your home is one of the more significant costs associated with home ownership. But, it needs to also be seen as a long-term financial investment. All of the latest heaters are far more energy-efficient than those installed even twenty years back. So, while it might appear like a short-term bigger expense, a new, more energy-efficient home heating unit will more than most likely save you cash in the longer-term by decreasing your yearly energy expenses.<p>
<p>The majority of well and city water does not normally contain lead. Water generally picks up lead inside the home from home pipes that is made with lead products. The only way to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated. Contact the local health department or the water provider to discover how to get the water tested. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
