<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise regulating the temperature level of the floor.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
