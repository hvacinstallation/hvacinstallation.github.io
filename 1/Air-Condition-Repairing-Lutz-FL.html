If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
