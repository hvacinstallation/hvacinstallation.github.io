<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not offer them.. Second of all like prolonged automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
