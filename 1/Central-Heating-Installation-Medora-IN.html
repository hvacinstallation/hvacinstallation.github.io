<p>Just like many home enhancement jobs, the cost of a complete central heater can differ widely based on the size of the home. The majority of heaters will last in between 15 and 20 years. In picking a furnace, property owners need to consider heat output and performance. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A little home, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and turn off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
