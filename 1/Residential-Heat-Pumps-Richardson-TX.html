I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
