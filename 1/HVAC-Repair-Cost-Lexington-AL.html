<p>Chemical contaminants: Volatile natural compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and common. They include both human-made and naturally happening chemical substances. Chemical contaminants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the structure (e.g., workplace equipment; floor, furnishings and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Often, indoor air quality problems in large commercial buildings can not be efficiently recognized or remedied without a comprehensive building examination. These investigations might start with written questionnaires and telephone assessments in which structure investigators evaluate the history of resident symptoms and building operation procedures. In some cases, these inquiries might rapidly discover the issue and on-site visits are unnecessary.<p>
