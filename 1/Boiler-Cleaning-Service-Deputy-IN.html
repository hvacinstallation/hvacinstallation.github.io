<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment producer's to guarantee your factory guarantees stay in location. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is often tough to measure, as one reaction stated the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c do not just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the result of repeated use of an element that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing premature degeneration, resulting in cracks and holes. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.  a very advantageous outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
