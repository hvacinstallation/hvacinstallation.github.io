Of course, too-dry air can also irritate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the growth of germs and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Immediate impacts may show up after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate impacts are treatable and generally short-term. Often the treatment is just getting rid of the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Signs of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also appear soon after exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
