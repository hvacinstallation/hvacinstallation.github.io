<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are less common now than gas, but they can be helpful in more remote regions where energies are harder to gain access to, and in colder climates since it provides more heat per BTU than other solutions. The installation cost will be lower, but energy expenses will be higher, as much as three times higher than gas or electric heaters. They need a storage tank on the instant residential or commercial property and more maintenance. Overall, they cost between $2,000 and $8,000 to install. In general, they provide an AFUE score of between 80 and 90 percent.<p>
