<h3>Is The Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Agar SD?</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the math lately, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was essential and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater due to the fact that the professionals thought they simply didn't seem best and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
