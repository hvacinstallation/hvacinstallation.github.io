Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
