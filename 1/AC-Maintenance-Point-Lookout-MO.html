<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies.

Second of all, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable wetness barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of if it becomes damp.<p>
