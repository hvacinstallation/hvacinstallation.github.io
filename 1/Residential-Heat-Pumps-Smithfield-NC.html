<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
