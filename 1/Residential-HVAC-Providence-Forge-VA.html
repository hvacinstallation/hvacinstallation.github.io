Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

It would be best if you left it to an experienced ac repair Houston Midtown tech for correct HVAC diagnosis. Always ensure when checking your air conditioning equipment to turn off all main power from the emergency breaker panel or detach switch.
