<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
