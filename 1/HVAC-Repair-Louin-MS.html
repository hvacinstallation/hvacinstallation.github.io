<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the performance and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by people and animals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
