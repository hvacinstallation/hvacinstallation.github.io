The possibility of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon a number of elements including age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether an individual reacts to a pollutant depends on specific level of sensitivity, which differs enormously from individual to individual. Some people can become sensitized to chemical or biological pollutants after repeated or high level exposures.<p>

<p>You might upgrade to the highest effectiveness equipment available and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days.
