<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. Once the circuitry is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly treat and harden-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants.
