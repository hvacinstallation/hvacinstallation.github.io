<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

(If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
