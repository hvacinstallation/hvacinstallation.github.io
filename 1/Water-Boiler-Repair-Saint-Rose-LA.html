<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more troubles, because some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not use them.  Second of all like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the unit has been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<h3>Air Condition System in Saint Rose LA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
