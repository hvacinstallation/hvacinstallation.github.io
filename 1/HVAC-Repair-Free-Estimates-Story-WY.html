<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor wisely, many of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
