<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>
