<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a properly sized system. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to provide sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
