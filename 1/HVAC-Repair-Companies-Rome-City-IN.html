<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
