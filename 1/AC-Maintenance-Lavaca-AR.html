<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
