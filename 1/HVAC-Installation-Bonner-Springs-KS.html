<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest won't come on. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
