<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
