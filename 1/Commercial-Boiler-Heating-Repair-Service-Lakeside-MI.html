<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else could come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to order it. My wife said that she had seen a great review for James, so I called.
