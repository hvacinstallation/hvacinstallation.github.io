<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices maker's to guarantee your factory guarantees stay in location. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one reaction mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repetitive usage of a component that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early deterioration, leading to fractures and holes. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the component.  a very beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
