Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
