<p>Streamline your services, earn more services revenue, and supply a fantastic customer experience. To make sure the unit you choose is the best size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load estimation estimate to figure out the exact kind of heat and a/c system that's ideal for your home-we do not just change it with the same size system you currently have. These computations take into account things such as the size of your house, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is vital so the unit isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters homes through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floors, floor drains pipes, and sumps. When radon ends up being trapped in concentrations and structures build up indoors, exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>

<p>There is a needed balance in making your decision though as systems with higher AFUE ratings often come with higher cost.

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface area ignitor) or electronic lighter goes bad, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down quickly.

If your furnace is more than ten years youâ and old $ re having other service done on it, think about having the ignitor and flame sensor replaced as preventative maintenance because the cost will be less when the technician is currently there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>
