Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
