<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source.

A standard air conditioner transfers heat out of the space since its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, because all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
