What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide should be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
