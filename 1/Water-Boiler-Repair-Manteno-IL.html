<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Another option to oil heaters are gas heating systems While oil is typically utilized in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have an option in between the two types. Gas heaters cost about the same, roughly $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real benefit of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, as opposed to the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
<p>Because heating & cooling work may also need setting up or repairing pipes to supply oil or natural gas to heating devices, an HVAC contractor might likewise be needed to hold a different plumbing's license or have a certified plumbing technician on call. Nevertheless, some jurisdictions license HVAC contractors specifically for this line of work. When getting an estimate, make certain to ask not only if a company is certified, but also what type of license it holds.<p>
