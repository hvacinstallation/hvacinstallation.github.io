<p>My oldest kid constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the issue, all the while discussing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
