<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
