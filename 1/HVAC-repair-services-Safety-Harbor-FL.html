<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
