<p>These people have been fantastic. At a realtor, I in some cases need contractors to provide me an opinion for what work on a home may cost. Recently I needed to get in touch with these guys twice. They came out rapidly and provided me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything.
