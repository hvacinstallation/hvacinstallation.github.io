<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
