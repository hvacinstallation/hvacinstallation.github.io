<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
