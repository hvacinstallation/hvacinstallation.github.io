<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably reduces direct exposure to pollutants during cooking.

If you buy a brand-new gas range or range, think about buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot burner that burns continually. Never use a gas range to heat your house. Constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>
