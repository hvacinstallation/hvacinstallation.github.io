<p>Central air systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an option for property owners to consider. Many times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, considering that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are typically only available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
