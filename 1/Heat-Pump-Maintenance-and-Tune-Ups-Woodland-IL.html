<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Woodland IL?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
