<p>Strategy on spending a number of thousand dollars for the total system if you are thinking about installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your house. The size of the system figures out the labor hours involved to construct the system. When you think about installation fees upwards of $50 per hour, to outfit a house with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand new furnace or more.<p>
<p>Generally the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to decrease the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-effective method to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Due to the fact that it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can eliminate you before you understand it remains in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes mild effects that are typically mistaken for the flu. These signs include headaches, dizziness, tiredness, disorientation and nausea. The results of CO direct exposure can differ greatly from person to person depending upon age, overall health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
