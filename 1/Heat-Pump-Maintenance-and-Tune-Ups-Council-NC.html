<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floors covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
