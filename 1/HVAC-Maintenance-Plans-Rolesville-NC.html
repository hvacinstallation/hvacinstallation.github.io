Building-Related Disease (BRI) refers to less regular (however typically more serious) cases of individuals becoming ill after being in a particular structure at a particular time. In these cases, there is generally a comparable set of scientific signs experienced by the people and a clear cause can typically be discovered upon examination. Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI brought on by bacteria which can contaminate a structure's a/c system.<p>
<p>Apartment or condos can have the same indoor air issues as single-family houses because much of the contamination sources, such as the interior building materials, home furnishings, and household items, are comparable. Indoor air problems similar to those in offices are caused by such sources as contaminated ventilation systems, incorrectly positioned outside air intakes, or maintenance activities.<p>

<h3>Is Your Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Rolesville NC?</h3>
<p>In the last a number of years, a growing body of clinical evidence has actually indicated that the air within houses and other structures can be more seriously polluted than the outdoor air in even the largest and most industrialized cities. Other research suggests that individuals invest around 90 percent of their time inside. Hence, for lots of people, the threats to health might be higher due to direct exposure to air pollution indoors than outdoors.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
