<p>My oldest child constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>

For example, people exhale co2, which in small quantities is not harmful, but may become hazardous if high concentrations are enabled to collect. Micro-organisms or bacteria may also be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they may spread throughout the entire work environment or building by ways of the ventilation system.<p>
