The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
