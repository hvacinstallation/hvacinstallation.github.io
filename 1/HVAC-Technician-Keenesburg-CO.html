<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not use them.  Second of all like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to properly service and the system has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
