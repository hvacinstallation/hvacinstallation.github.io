He showed the points of examination and also suggested I have a UV light installed due to a little buildup of mold collecting in the air handler, which he completely examined and cleaned the exterior compressor coils along with ensured the wetness discharge tube was clear by using a cleaning liquid and a store vacuum. He likewise got rid of the leaves that built up inside the interior of the compressor unit and advised a solution to prevent it from continuing, which will do.I received a comprehensive email report of the inspection outlining all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is a property to Waychoff's and I highly advise him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>
