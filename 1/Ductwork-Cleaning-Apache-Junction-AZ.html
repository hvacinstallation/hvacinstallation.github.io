<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in collecting information on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and offered clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.
