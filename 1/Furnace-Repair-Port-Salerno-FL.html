<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely helpful in collecting details on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
<p>The most typical type of house heating unit in the U.S. burns gas or gas to produce heat. With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least costly option, but newer systems can be really energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older gas systems typically attain a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, extremely effective gas furnaces can accomplish AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
