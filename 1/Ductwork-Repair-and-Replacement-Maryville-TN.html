<h3>Residential Heat Pumps in Maryville TN</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
