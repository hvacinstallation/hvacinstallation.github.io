Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan.
