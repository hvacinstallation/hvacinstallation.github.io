<p>Having a wood-burning heating system can be incredibly effective in terms of cost. If you have access to totally free or cheap firewood, or you cut your own wood from your woodlot, it may not cost you anything. Sadly, wood-burning heating systems require a really crucial natural resource: wood! Because of the quantity of wood needed to properly heat your whole house, wood-burning heat systems may not be fantastic for the environment despite being carbon neutral.<p>
<p>Examine these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
