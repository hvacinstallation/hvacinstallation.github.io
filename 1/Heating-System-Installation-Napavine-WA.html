Running on electrical power, a heatpump is a cost-efficient service utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, but in reverse.

<p>The first a/c unit and refrigerators utilized hazardous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
