<h3>HVAC Repair Free Estimates in The Dalles OR</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
