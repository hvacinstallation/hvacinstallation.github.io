<p>Certain immediate impacts are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often tough to determine if the symptoms are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is essential to take notice of the time and place the signs happen. If the symptoms fade or disappear when an individual is far from the home and return when the individual returns, an effort must be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes.

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
