<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service at Grand Junction CO</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging long trenches or deep holes to install the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.

The lack of moving parts indicates you're less likely to spend big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're considerably more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source units.<p>
