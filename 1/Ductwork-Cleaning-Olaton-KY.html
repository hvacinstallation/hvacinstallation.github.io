<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, go to Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
