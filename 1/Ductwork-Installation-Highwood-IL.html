<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as vital as a regular oil change in your automobile. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
