<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.  Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the system has actually been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
