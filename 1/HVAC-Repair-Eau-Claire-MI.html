I feel like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging long trenches or deep holes to install the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll save cash over the long term because of the lower energy costs. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as standard air-source units.
