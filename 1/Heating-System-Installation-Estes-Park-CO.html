<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The purpose of the majority of structure ventilation systems is to generate sufficient fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building safety at sensible energy costs. Load computing is referred to as the Handbook J computation and ought to be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or system cost for cooling. If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based upon experience or on square footage alone, move to another contractor.

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.
