<h3>Heating And Cooling Repair in Lehigh Acres FL</h3>
<p>New air conditioners generally range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER ranking suggests greater energy effectiveness and potentially lower energy costs. A great SEER ranking for you depends on your home size, where you live and other aspects. Even the minimally enabled SEER rating is going to be far more energy efficient than your existing, old ac system. It's not always about picking the model with the greatest SEER ranking, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can help.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it might flatter two times the electrical power that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's since it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to offer a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices installed just a few years ago.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as vital as a routine oil change in your automobile. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter better traps impurities and particles in the air. When every three months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
