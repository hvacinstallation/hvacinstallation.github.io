<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. Connection problems along the line that supplies power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the system. Loose, missing or faulty wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace involves inspecting the recommended connections as well as temperature and pressure gauges. Require time to examine these parts for dust and damage, making certain that they are safe and tight.<p>
