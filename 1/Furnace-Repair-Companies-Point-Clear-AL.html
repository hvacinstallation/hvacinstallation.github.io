<p>Specific immediate effects resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently difficult to figure out if the symptoms are a result of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this factor, it is important to focus on the time and place the signs take place. If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort should be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes.
