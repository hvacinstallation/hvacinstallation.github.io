The female crimp connectors ought to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
