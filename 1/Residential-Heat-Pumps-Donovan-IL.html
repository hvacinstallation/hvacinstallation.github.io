<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce contaminants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those procedures consist of generating outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
