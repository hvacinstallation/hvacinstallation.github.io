The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most budget friendly if your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
