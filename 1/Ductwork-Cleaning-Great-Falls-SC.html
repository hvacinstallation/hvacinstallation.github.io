<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and hence requires conditions suitable for both organisms. The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, consisting of chlorine. Remediation for Legionella outbreaks in commercial buildings vary, but often consist of extremely warm water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and sometimes flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventive procedures include changing regular hot water levels to enable 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, assessing center style layout, removing faucet aerators, and regular screening in suspect locations.<p>
<p>As a structure owner or center supervisor, you need to think about the cost of unanticipated downtime and the effect older, inefficient systems have on the bottom line. Running your existing devices to failure will involve ever-increasing service costs, in addition to the anxiety of unanticipated system interruptions. However with planned capital replacement, you can put the focus on energy effectiveness and cost savings opportunities, and gain peace of mind while doing so.<p>
