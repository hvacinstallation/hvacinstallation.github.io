<p>Sean was really handy. He is a very enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
