<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>In some cases a temporary indoor air quality issue is produced just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more intricate concerns-- determined by regularly unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the three methods below may be suitable.<p>
