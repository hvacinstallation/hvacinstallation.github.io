<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product gradually. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
