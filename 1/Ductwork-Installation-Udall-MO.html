<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from products or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time fixing the problem, all the while explaining whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
