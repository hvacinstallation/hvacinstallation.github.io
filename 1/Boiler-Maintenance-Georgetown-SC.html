<p>I am replacing our High Speed System since of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11.

<p>Next, and perhaps just as crucial when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size.

On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
