<p>I am replacing our High Speed System since of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11.

<p>Next, and perhaps just as crucial when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
