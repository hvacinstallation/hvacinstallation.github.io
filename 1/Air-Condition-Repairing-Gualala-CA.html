<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most budget-friendly. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and cure-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
