<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to offer adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
