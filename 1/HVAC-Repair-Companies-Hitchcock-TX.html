<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>IÃ¢ $ m really choosy with my things. I like my devices and appliances initial, I wonÃ¢ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs.

<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment producer's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in place.

The majority of pieces of a furnace or ac system don't just break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of recurring usage of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature deterioration, leading to holes and fractures. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the part.. a very useful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
