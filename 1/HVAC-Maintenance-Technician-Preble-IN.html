<p>A specialized a/c that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioning system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the very same air path.

<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Preble IN Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Most modern air-conditioning systems include a dehumidification cycle throughout which the compressor runs while the fan is slowed as much as possible citation required to lower the evaporator temperature level and therefore condense more water. When the temperature level falls below a limit, both the fan and compressor are turned off to alleviate more temperature level drops; explanation required this prevents moisture on the evaporator from being blown back into the space. citation required When the temperature level rises again, clarification needed the compressor reboots and the fan returns to low speed.<p>
