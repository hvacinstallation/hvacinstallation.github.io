<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. Once the wiring is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms.

Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
