<p>Energy performance can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heater. Zones are controlled by several thermostats.

<p>A customized a/c that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning unit because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the very same air path. A standard a/c unit transfers heat energy out of the room since its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, given that all elements of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is really warmed, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
