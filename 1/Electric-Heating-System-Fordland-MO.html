<p>Many people understand that outdoor air contamination can affect their health, however indoor air contamination can also have considerable, damaging impact. EPA studies of human exposure to air pollutants suggest that indoor levels of contaminants might be two to five times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels.

<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll save cash over the long term since of the lower energy expenses. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as traditional air-source systems. The lack of moving parts implies you're less likely to spend big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're substantially more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source units.<p>
