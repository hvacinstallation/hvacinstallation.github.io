<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
