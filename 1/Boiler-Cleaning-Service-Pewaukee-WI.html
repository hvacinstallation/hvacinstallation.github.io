<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime.

This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

If you replace a furnace due to a bad heat exchanger, think about anÂ Amana, Goodman or Daikin since they have the best heat exchanger guarantees in the industry on their leading heaters.<p>
