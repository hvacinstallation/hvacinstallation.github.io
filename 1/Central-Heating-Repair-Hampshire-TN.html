<h3>Stop Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water at Hampshire TN</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the job based just on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few affordable ones received. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the expected quantity of time. post install evaluation results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 unit it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
