<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a reference later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
