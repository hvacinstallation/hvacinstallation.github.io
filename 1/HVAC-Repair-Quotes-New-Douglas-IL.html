<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each room. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
