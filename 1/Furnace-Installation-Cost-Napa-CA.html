<h3>Install New Air Conditioner in Napa CA</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>

<p>These guys have actually been excellent. At a real estate agent, I in some cases require contractors to provide me a viewpoint for what work on a house may cost. Just recently I required to get in touch with these guys twice. They came out rapidly and gave me a no nonsense estimate for the work.

Stability isn't just their name, it's a business model they take seriously. You guys are formally on speed dial. Talk to you soon.<p>
<p>My oldest son always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I understood that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think about anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The sound level is itâ and low $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement tries to upsell you whenever they come to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for 7 years, even though it was six months prior to the existing one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
