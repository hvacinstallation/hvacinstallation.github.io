<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise managing the temperature of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is dry and unblocked.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, but it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there are in a space or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have an unfavorable influence on occupants-- outside air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
