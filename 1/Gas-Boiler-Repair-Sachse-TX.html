<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
