<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
