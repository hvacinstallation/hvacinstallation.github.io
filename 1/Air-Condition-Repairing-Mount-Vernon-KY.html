<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the job and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has actually been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
