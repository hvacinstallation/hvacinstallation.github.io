<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
