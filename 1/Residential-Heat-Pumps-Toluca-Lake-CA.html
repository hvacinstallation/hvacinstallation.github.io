<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor.

Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year.

Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
