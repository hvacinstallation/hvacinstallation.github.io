<p>Given that the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they produce more effective.

There are numerous approaches for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more tough to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
