<p>Given that the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they produce more effective. This was originally driven by rising energy costs, and has more just recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental problems. Furthermore, improvements to the HVAC system performance can also help increase resident health and performance. 21 In the United States, the EPA has actually enforced tighter constraints over the years. There are numerous approaches for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more tough to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those procedures consist of bringing in outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
