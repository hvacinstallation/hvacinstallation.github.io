<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your Oakville CA Home</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality problems are not restricted to homes. In fact, lots of office buildings have considerable air contamination sources A few of these structures might be inadequately aerated. For instance, mechanical ventilation systems may not be created or operated to supply adequate amounts of outdoor air. Finally, individuals normally have less control over the indoor environment in their workplaces than they do in their houses. As a result, there has been a boost in the occurrence of reported health problems.<p>
