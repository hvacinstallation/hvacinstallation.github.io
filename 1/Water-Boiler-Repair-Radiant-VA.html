<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to choose whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, search for signs of issues with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can show your house might not have sufficient ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or smelly air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items end up being moldy. To spot odors in your home, action outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are obvious.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For example, people exhale co2, which in small amounts is not toxic, but may become dangerous if high concentrations are permitted to accumulate.

They might spread throughout the whole office or structure by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
