<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor system.

Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Don't stress! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it just may require 24 volts of electrical power.
