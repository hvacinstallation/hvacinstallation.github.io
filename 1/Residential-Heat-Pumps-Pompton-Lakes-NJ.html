<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature, and after that switch it ON.

You ought to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
