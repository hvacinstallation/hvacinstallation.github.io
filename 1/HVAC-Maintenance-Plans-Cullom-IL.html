<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
