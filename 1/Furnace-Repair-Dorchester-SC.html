The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor pollutants and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>

A voided service warranty will not do you any excellent must the system stop working or malfunction. Do it right from the outset and hire a licensed person with the experience to install the system.<p>
