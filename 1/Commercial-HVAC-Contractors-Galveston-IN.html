<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
