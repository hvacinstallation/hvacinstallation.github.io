<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, most Midtown Houston Tx customers do not understand why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's more than likely your issue. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing, then the next step is to defrost your a/c equipment. The most convenient way to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
