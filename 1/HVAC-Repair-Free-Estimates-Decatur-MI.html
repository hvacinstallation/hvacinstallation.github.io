However, select your contractor wisely, a number of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around fixing the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
