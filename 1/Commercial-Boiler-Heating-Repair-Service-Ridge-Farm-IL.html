<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heating systems have numerous control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the brand-new control board must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t appropriately diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a professional to diagnose.<p>
