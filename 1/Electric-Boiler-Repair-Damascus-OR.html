Naturally, too-dry air can also irritate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are prone to cold areas", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot beside the radiators.
