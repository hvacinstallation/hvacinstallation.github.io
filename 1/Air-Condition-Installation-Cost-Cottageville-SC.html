<p>Poor indoor air quality is usually caused by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which results in an accumulation of impurities from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the main issue in more than half the workplace indoor air investigations it has actually conducted. Investigations performed in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the very same to be true. These examinations revealed that correct ventilation is necessary in maintaining excellent indoor air quality.<p>

<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years earlier and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
