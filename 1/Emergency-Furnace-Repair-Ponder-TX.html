<p>Oil heaters are normally not really efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, however most do not accomplish an efficiency higher than 90%. A couple of high-end brands have an effectiveness of 95% by using a condenser. These are more pricey, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation also since a drain requires to be installed.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur over time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.
