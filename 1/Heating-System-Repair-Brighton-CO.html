<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Important Company in Los Angeles.

<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All objects in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the radiant heat system has been operating for a while, including individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>

<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," listed below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan ought to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins but the fan doesn't. Shut off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan begins. , if it does not, you have actually provided it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
