<p>In addition to getting the big image" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be established to offer threshold signals. If, for example, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could establish your tracking devices to notify you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the proper action to resolve the situation immediately.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The goal is to offer enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
