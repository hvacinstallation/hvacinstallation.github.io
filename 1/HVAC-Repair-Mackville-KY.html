<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power needs to not go beyond the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems higher than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, considering that the total capability of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside unit. Put simply, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the overall power is not easy, given that it takes into consideration not just the small power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

However, new installation practices are lowering expenses, to the point where the rate is getting closer to standard systems under the right conditions.<p>
