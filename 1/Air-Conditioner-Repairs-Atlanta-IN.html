<p>As much of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in place. Moreover, the concrete results of a PM is often tough to measure, as one response stated the savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the result of repetitive use of an element that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature degeneration, leading to cracks and holes. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.  a very helpful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
