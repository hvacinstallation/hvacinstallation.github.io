The main path of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might enter nearby ventilation consumption.

The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
