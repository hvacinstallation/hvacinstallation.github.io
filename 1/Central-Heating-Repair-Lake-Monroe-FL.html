<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. Connection problems along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the system. Loose, malfunctioning or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace involves checking the advised connections as well as temperature level and pressure gauges. Take some time to examine these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are tight and safe.<p>
<p>A SEER score means Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the very same duration. Basically, SEER supplies more data based on how the EER performs in various temperatures. The greater the unit's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
