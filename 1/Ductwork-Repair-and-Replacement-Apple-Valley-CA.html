<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>As discussed above, activating your new under tile floor heater too soon, prior to the mortar has actually treated, can cause the grout to break or to not adhere effectively, and might void the guarantee of your mortar product. In some screening, even the tile split when the system was run before the compound had treated. And mortar makers might decline warranty protection if you do not follow their directions.<p>
