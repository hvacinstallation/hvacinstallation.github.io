Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
