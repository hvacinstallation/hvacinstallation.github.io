<p>The predominant health impact associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
