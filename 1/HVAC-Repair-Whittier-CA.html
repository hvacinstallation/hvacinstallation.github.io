<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
