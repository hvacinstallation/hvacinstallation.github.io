<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to reduce the quantity of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps must also be taken to minimize contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for advised actions.) In addition, residents must be alert to the introduction of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization measures ought to not be undertaken till these problems have been fixed.<p>
<p>The bureau tasks 34 percent work development for HVAC specialists between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all occupations. Several factors add to this, including the replacement and upgrade of older cooling systems to fulfill stricter ecological regulations. The slow rebound in residential and commercial building will produce a consistent circulation of new opportunities, especially for service technicians who are willing to transfer. New systems are more computerized and sophisticated, so specialists who have completed formal training programs at a technical or community college might have a benefit over those who learn on the task.<p>

By setting up dehumidification devices inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy a few of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without changing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, improving indoor air quality and enabling higher convenience at greater temperatures.<p>
