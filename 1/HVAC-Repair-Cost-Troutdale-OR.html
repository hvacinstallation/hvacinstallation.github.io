<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Your Review This is my third time using All the time. Ilan constantly makes himself available - whether it's a heating issue in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is proficient with these gadgets). I have absolutely nothing but fantastic things to state - he has actually taken good care of my heating and AC needs. Quick action - fast resolution.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
