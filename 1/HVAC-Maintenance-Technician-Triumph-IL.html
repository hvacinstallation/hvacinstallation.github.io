<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
