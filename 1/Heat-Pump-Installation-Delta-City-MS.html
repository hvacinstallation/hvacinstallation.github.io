The crew took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating unit. We decided on getting something more costly than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
