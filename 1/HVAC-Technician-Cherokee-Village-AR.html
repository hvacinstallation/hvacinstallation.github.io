<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been correctly dried. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
