<h3>Truth About Bolingbrook IL Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature, and after that switch it ON.

You ought to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
