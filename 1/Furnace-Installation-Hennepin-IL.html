<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that allow higher air flow from the outside, air quality tracking platforms and sensors, and new air filtration technologies are becoming more common as readily available solutions in commercial and residential HVAC product packages.

From there you can take the proper action to solve the situation right away.<p>
