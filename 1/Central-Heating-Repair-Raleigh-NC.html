<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate terrific however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced.

<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a service was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to construct business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end objective. HVAC company owner must strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
