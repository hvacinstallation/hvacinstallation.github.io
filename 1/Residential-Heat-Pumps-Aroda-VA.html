<p>While radon in water is not an issue in houses served by many public water products, it has actually been found in well water. If you have actually tested the air in your house and discovered a radon problem, and you have a well, contact a lab licensed to measure radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon problems in water can be readily fixed. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
<p>Most well and city water does not typically consist of lead. Water generally picks up lead inside the house from home pipes that is made with lead materials.

Send for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water.
