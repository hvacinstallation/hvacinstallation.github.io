<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC specialists like Dave Mejean of B&W Plumbing & Heating in Indianapolis.

<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
