<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must watch out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
