Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
