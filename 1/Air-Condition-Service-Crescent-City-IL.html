From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was required and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater since the specialists thought they just didn't seem ideal and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
