<p>Sean was very handy. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to buy additional things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
