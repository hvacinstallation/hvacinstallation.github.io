<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics recently, but I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular assessments. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the unit sits.
