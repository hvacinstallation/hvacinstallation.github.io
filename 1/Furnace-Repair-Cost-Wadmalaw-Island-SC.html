For this reason, it is necessary to take notice of the time and location the signs happen. If the symptoms fade or go away when a person is far from the house and return when the person returns, an effort must be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Wadmalaw Island SC</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
