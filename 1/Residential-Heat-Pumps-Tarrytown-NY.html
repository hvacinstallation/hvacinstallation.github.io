The reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the signs up.

<h3>HVAC Repair Quotes in Tarrytown NY</h3>

<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not offer off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
