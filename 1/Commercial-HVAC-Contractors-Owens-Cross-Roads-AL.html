<p>Unstable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from processes or products; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, human beings exhale carbon dioxide, which in small quantities is not toxic, however may become hazardous if high concentrations are allowed to build up. Micro-organisms or germs may also be present within the ventilation system. They may spread out throughout the entire work environment or building by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
