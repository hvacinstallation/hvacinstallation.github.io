<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw.
