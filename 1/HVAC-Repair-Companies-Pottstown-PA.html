<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Pottstown PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
