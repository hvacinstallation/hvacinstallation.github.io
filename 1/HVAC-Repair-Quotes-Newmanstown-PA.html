<h3>Advantages of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Newmanstown PA</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in home building and construction is to minimize air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, floors, and walls. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air helps and dilutes indoor impurities tire them from the home.<p>
