<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather.

The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
