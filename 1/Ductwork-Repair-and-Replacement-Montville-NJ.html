Too large and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can damage the ac system and shorten its life. Too small and your ac system won't be able to cool your home effectively. These are just a few of the factors that you need to take into account when buying a new AC system. Each option can and will considerably impact your system's performance, which is why you can't pay for to neglect any of them.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your home that best temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the road. So, make sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service plan which usually consists of a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
