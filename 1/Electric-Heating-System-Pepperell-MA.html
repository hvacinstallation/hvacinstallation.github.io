<h3>Home Furnace in Pepperell MA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my requirements totally by supplying a professional quote with options, without pushing extra products. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also immediately followed up with the necessary inspections from the city.
