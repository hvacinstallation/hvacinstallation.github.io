Improperly situated outdoor air consumption vents can also generate air polluted with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>

<p>A specific air conditioner that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a standard ac system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the same air course. A basic air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the room since its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, because all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is really heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
