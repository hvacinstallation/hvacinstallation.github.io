Sources now tell KrebsOnSecurity that the vendor in question was a refrigeration, heating and air  conditioning subcontractor that has operated at a number of locations at Target and other top retailers.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
