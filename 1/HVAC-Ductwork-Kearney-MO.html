<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your air conditioning unit is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leakages, simply including refrigerant is not an option. An experienced technician must fix any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the performance and performance of your a/c unit is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the maker's specification, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be damaging to the environment.<p>

Poorly located outdoor air intake vents can likewise generate air contaminated with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological pollutants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>
