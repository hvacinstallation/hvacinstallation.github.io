<h3>Common Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Star ID</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor system rather of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Because an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
