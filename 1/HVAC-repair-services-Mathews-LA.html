<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>
