<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same.

Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately harden and cure-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
