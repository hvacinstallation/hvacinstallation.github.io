<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heater, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
