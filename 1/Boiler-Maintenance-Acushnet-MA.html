<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- offer All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work very well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Operating on electrical power, a heatpump is an economical service utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, but in reverse. Rather of warming or cooling the air currently inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and presses it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems.

Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
