<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure fact that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is simply as crucial as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will often build up in ductwork, limiting airflow.

When you choose Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't need to fret about a thing.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning system and fridges utilized flammable or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
