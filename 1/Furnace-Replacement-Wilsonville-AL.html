<p>A vehicle's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being old and dirty. The old coolant will adversely affect the system's performance. To make sure the system is working successfully, think about having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your car's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
