<p>UW workers, visitors and students need to have a tidy, healthy environment in which to work, study and perform various activities. , if the air quality is poor it can impact an individual's healthConvenience comfort, and productivity.. The function of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to supply and maintain healthy and comfy environments free of contaminants. An essential part of the program is responding to and solving issues of building occupants about issues in their work environment.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in collecting information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>

For instance, a heat exchanger might fail too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature deterioration, resulting in cracks and holes. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.. an extremely useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
