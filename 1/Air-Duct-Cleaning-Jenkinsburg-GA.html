<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
