<p>Appropriate ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same toxins. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioning conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet contains the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet consists of the evaporator. In many split-system a/c unit, this indoor cabinet also consists of a furnace or the indoor part of a heat pump. The air conditioning unit's evaporator coil is installed in the cabinet or main supply duct of this furnace or heat pump. If your house already has a furnace but no air conditioner, a split-system is the most cost-effective central air conditioning conditioner to set up.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaky return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

Briefly increasing ventilation combined with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>

<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
