<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat.

As soon as the circuitry is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively harden and cure-- typically 2 to 4 weeks.

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
