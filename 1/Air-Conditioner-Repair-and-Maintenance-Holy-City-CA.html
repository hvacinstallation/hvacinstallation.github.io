Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter.

<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly treat and solidify-- usually two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
