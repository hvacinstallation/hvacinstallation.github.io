One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are required to resist present, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>5. Smell excellent naturally.
