<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
