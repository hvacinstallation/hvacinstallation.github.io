Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>

<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
