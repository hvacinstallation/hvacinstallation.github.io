<p>A Lot Of Midtown Houston Tx clients do not know why their HVAC unit is not working when they position a 24 hr emergency ac repair request.

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of pollutant direct exposure. An example of time control is arranging flooring removing and waxing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This enables items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the staff are at home over the weekend. Place control includes moving the pollutant source far from occupants or perhaps moving prone residents.<p>

After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance.
