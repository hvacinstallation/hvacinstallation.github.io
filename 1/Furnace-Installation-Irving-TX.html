<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to supply sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
