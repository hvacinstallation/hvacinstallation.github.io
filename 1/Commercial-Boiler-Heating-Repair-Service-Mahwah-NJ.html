<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. If your a/c is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Simply adding refrigerant is not a solution if it leakages. A trained technician should fix any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant.

Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also must be properly kept to prevent germs and mold contamination.<p>
