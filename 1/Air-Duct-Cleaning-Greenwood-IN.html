<h3>Designing Tips for Central Heating Systems in Greenwood IN</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the taken in heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas.
