<p>If you set it too low, you're motivating the development of mold in moist air. The heat dries out the air, preventing mold growth and contamination. Of course, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Martin stated the company is ready to put down roots" in the Tri-Cities and anticipates to have a team of about seven to 10 staff members when it unlocks on the new facility by early fall. This includes existing technicians who represent the company in the market and become part of its total worker base of 800 staffers, with 1,000 workers anticipated to be on the job for MacDonald-Miller this summer season.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more challenging to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>Sometimes a short-lived indoor air quality problem is created merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more complex issues-- identified by consistently unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, among the 3 techniques below might be appropriate.<p>
