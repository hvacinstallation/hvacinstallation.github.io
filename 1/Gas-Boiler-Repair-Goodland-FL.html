<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out repairing the problem, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
