<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
