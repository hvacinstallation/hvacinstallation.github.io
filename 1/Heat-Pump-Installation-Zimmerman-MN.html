Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that secure your a/c system from flooding. One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan.
