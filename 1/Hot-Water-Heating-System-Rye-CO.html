<h3>HVAC Repair in Rye CO</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite HEATING AND COOLING on among the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to evaluate circumstance & chose to go with them for the work. I am happy to state that not only did we get the central air going but likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everybody we talked with from starting to end were extremely professional, courteous and the work was extremely effectively done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 Â° F and an indoor temp of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to offer sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
