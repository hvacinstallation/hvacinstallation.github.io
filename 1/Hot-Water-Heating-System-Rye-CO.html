<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.
