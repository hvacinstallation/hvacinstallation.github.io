<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide must be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements used for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
