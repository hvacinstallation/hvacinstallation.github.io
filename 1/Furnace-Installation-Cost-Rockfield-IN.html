<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
