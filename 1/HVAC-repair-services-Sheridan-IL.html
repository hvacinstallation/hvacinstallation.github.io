<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives ask for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Updating to a brand-new heater is a huge choice and a major investment. Educated consumers require enhanced home health, energy performance, and convenience.

"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price great but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
