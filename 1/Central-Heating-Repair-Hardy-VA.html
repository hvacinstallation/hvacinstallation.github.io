<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was really valuable in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not emit heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen in time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick till you buy a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
