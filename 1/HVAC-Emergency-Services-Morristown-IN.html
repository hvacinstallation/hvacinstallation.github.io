<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We chose getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
