<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides heat from the flooring up throughout the room with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to supply sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
