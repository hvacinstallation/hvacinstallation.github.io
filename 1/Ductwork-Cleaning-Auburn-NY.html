<p>Do you require to change or repair part of your house's HVAC system?

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
