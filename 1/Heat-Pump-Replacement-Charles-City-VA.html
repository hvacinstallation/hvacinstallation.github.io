ProTex properly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up examination outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it replaced (also Provider).<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Ensure all the signs up in the house are large open.

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
