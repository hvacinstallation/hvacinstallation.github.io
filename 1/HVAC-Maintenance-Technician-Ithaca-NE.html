<p>If the AC does not turn off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place with time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.
