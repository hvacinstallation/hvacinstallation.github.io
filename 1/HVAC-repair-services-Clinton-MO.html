<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. Once the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately solidify and cure-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
