<h3>Commercial HVAC in Independence OH</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>

When it does require to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
