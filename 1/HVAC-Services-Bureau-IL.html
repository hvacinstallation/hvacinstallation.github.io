<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in collecting details on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.
