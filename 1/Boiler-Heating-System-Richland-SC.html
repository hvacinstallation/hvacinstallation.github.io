<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is developed for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other professionals interested in indoor air quality. Our technicians describe all of your choices before starting the repair, so you can decide whether a repair or replacement is best for you. Our No Surprises Pricing-- including charging by the task, not by the hour-- means the cost we estimate you is the cost you pay. If you choose that changing your furnace is the best strategy, we can set up a brand-new, high-efficiency model in its location.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years approximately. Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Photo 6).<p>

A furnace that is too small, on the other hand, will not be able to supply sufficient heat to keep your home comfortable.<p>
<p>Brands brought: When seeking estimates for new or replacement heating or cooling equipment make certain to ask prospective companies what particular manufacturers or devices brands they bring.
