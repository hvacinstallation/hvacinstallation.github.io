<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating elements set up in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is described as radiant heat.<p>
