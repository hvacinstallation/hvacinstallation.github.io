<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>
<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough task that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps guys working. When a sales man pertains to your home he exists to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and must not "require" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the alternatives for your requirements and you choose if you need it.<p>

<p>Indoor contaminants.
