<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Newark IL</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
