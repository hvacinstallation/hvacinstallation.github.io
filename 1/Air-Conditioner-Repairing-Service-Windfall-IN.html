<h3>Furnace Repair Cost in Windfall IN</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
