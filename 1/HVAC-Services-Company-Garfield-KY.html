If the signs fade or go away when an individual is far from the location, for instance, an effort should be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature level, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
