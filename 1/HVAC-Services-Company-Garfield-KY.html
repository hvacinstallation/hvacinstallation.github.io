If the signs fade or go away when an individual is far from the location, for instance, an effort should be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature level, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on.
