<p>One of the drawbacks of central heating is that it's possibly pricey to set up, especially in an older house. Depending upon the kind of unit set up, it can be loud and trigger problems if you're extremely allergic to dust.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
