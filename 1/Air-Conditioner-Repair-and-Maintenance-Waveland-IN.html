<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 need to be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
