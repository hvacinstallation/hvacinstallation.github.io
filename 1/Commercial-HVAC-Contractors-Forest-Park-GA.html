However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside.

<p>Because an air conditioner moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept clean. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean up the condenser coil.
