<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the floor.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
