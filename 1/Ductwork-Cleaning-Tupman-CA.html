<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, a lot of commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which may get in nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
