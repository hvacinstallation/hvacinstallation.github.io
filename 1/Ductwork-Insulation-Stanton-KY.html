<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
