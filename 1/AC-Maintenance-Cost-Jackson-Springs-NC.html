<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
