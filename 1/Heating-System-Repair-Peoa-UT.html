Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
