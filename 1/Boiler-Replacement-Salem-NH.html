The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>The growing interest in smart houses, in which heating and air conditioning systems can be managed remotely, might be another potential opportunity for sales.

An organisation plan for an HVAC company that plans to pursue this opportunity requires to show a high level of understanding about smart home HVAC items and customer adoption.<p>
