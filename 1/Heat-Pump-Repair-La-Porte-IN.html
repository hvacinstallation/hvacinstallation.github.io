<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
