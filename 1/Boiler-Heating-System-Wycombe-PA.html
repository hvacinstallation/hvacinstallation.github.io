<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor system as near to the house as possible per my request.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
