During usage, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the living space.<p>
<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, however for individuals who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have breathing issues, winter season can intensify issues.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
