<p>Make sure there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else restricting the flow of air. Not just will blocked vents and signs up affect your convenience, they can also cause duct leaks due to excessive atmospheric pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and signs up in unused rooms is NOT a great idea. You will not save any money and will wind up causing more issues for your heating unit.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. A great place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Structure Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Supervisors with BPI accreditation know that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one aspect (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>Generally the most reliable method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more affordable technique to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later in this section.<p>
