<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil.
