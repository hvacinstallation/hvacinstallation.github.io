Another repair indication is whether you had to wait to get parts changed. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be really cold on a below no night.<p>
<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy.

However, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold development and wetness indoors is associated with a greater prevalence of resident respiratory problems.<p>

<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, since it is protected indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical standards eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat with time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
