<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
