<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<h3>Residential HVAC in Mershon GA</h3>
<p>Forced air systems are the most common heater types on the marketplace, but they're not always the best choice for every single home. If you're trying to find a brand-new heating unit for your house, you should take a look at a few of the other options available prior to settling on a system that may not fit your requirements best. Radiant heat, for example, may be a better fit for your needs.<p>

High-efficiency models cost more, but save more over the long haul. Prices for gas heating systems vary from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models up to $12,500 for high-efficiency designs.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
