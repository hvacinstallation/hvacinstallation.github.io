This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a company was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't completion objective. HVAC company owner should strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>
