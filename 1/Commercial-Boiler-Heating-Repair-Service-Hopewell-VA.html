For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature degeneration, leading to fractures and holes. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.  an extremely advantageous result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
