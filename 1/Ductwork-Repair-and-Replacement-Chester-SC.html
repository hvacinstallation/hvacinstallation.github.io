A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller home, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
