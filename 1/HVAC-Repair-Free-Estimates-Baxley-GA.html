<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtering. From one of the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some fundamental maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping airborne contaminants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system carrying out well by helping reduce the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
