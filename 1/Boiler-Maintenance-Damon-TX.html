<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.

<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably reduces direct exposure to contaminants throughout cooking. Incorrect change, typically suggested by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame suggestion is blue.
