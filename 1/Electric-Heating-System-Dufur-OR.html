<p>Enhance your services, earn more services revenue, and provide a fantastic consumer experience. To make certain the unit you select is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation estimate to identify the specific type of heat and a/c system that's just right for your home-we do not simply replace it with the exact same size system you currently have. These computations think about things such as the size of your home, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is vital so the unit isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your house still heats to the ideal temperature level. The temperature level of the air produced by the heat pump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel very hot. If your home is not heating up, only be concerned. However, if your system does not seem working properly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you should contact an expert to check and repair the unit.<p>
