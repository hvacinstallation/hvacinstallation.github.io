<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Similar to a lot of home enhancement projects, the cost of a full central heating system can vary commonly based on the size of the house. A lot of furnaces will last between 15 and 20 years.

Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A small home, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too quickly and shut down for too long, resulting in irregular temperature level levels.<p>
