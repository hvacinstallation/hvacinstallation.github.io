<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
