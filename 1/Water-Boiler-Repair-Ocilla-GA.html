<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The first ac system and refrigerators used combustible or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

Air pressure distinctions produced by these forces move air-borne pollutants from locations of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the inside pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
<p>HVAC coils typically provide you an excellent 15-20 years of life prior to they begin developing refrigerant leaks. Refrigerant leakages aren't the only issue cooling coils have. Coils, after many years, lose the ability to transfer heat appropriately.
