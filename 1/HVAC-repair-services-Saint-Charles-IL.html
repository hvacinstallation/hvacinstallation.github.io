<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
