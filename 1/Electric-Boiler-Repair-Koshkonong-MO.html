<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside your home. A lot of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate.
