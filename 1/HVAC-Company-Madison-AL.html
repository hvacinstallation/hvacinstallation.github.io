They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
