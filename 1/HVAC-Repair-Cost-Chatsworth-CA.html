<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered by a Chatsworth CA HVAC Company</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes much more severe with lower outside temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more standard form of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
