<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>

You'll wish to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperatures reach freezing.

<p>First of all, The after hours addressing service agent, John, was very polite and expert. Second Of All, Gracion W is a prompt, educated technician. He was at my home within the time he offered me, repaired the issue while explaining the problem then stayed a number of minutes to ensure it was working correctly. The concern was repaired in a matter of time that I've never ever seen before while being a homeowner for 10 years. I also recommend one of the Defense Strategies, which I belong to, if you like to conserve cash. Thank you." Karen P.<p>
