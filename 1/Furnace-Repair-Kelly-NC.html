<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
