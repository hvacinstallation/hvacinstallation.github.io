<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having solved the problem with an easy repair he did on-site, not changing the entire part. He got along, simple and a completely satisfying person to have around that entire time. His time and competence to RESOLVE the issue cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a somewhat unpredictable diagnostic.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). However, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible for the most part, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores.

<p>Just like most home enhancement projects, the cost of a complete central heating system can vary commonly based on the size of the home. Most furnaces will last in between 15 and 20 years.
