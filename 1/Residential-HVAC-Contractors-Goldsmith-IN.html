He's said a number of times that the distinct code function is many and optional, many retailers don't use it because it slows down deals even more due to the back-and-forth interactions required.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to supply sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
