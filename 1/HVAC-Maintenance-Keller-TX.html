<p>In basic, ductless AC systems are more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient than traditional A/cs. Since you can turn off individual rooms when you're not occupying them, this is. On top of that, ductless Air conditioners can raise and reduce their temperature level easily, saving you energy and cash that regular HVAC compressors will waste by continuously starting up and turning themselves off.<p>
<p>Immediate results may appear after a single exposure or repeated exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate impacts are treatable and usually short-term. In some cases the treatment is just removing the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also appear not long after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
