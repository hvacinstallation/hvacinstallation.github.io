<p>Chemical toxins: Unstable organic substances ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are various, differed, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally taking place chemical substances.

<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight versus the cold in your home during the chillier months of the year, however for people who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have breathing problems, winter can intensify problems.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
