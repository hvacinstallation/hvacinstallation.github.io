If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively simple process. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>

<p>A geothermal heater does not generate its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as oil, coal, or gas. Instead, it soaks up heat from within the earth.
