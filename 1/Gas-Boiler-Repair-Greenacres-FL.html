<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heater, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
