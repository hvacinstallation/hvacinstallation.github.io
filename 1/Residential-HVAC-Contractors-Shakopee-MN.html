A ductless system has a built-in performance advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Due to the fact that they do not require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions.

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively simple to determine surrogate for indoor pollutants produced by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high inside may cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in the majority of structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging long trenches or deep holes to install the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll conserve cash over the long term because of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as traditional air-source units. The lack of moving parts suggests you're less likely to invest huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're significantly more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source units.<p>
