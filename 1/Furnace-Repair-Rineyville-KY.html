<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately solidify and treat-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
