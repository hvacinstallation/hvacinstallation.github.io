<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise apartments bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually viewed the single-family house installation organisation completely turn on its head the last few years. Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to up to three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with newbies more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the entire surface of a floor warms the lower half of the space, covering inhabitants in heat at a lower general temperature-- in some cases up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a standard heating unit." In other words, in-floor heating systems provide a various mode and level of convenience. And, as numerous public awareness campaigns have long reminded us, the more comfy we feel, the more inclined we might be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn reducing our energy expenditures.<p>
