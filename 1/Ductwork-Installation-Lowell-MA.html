<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical material with time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
