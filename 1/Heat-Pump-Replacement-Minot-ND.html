<h3>Choosing the Ideal HVAC System For The Job in Minot ND</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
