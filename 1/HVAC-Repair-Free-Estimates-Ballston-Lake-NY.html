<p>Buildings are designed or planned to respond actively to a few of these modifications around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and keep surfaces to boost their efficiency, longevity, or look. In other cases, such modifications subtly and even drastically change structures in manner ins which might be necessary to their own integrity or their effect on building occupants through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that specify them at any time.
