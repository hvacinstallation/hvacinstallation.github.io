<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
