<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil change in your vehicle. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear.

During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
