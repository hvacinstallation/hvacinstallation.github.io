<p>Martin stated the company is prepared to put down roots" in the Tri-Cities and expects to have a group of about 7 to 10 staff members when it opens the doors on the new facility by early fall.

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
