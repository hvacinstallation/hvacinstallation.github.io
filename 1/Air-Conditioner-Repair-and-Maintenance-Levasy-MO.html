<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, as opposed to industrial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the building. It may also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to individual spaces.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>
