<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing.

Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them till they have been effectively dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
