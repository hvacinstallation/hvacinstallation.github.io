This can be done by means of central heating Such a system consists of a heat, furnace, or boiler pump to heat water, steam, or air in a central location such as a furnace room in a house, or a mechanical room in a large structure. The heat can be moved by conduction, convection, or radiation Area heating units are used to heat single rooms and only consist of a single unit.<p>
<p>Another option to oil furnaces are gas heaters While oil is traditionally used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have a choice in between the 2 types. Gas heating systems cost about the very same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The genuine advantage of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, instead of the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
