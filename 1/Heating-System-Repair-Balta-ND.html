<p>A customized a/c that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the very same air course. A basic air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the room since its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, because all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact heated, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
