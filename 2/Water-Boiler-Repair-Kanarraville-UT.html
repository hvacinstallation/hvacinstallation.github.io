<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
