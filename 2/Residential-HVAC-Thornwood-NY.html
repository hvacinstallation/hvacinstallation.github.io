<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Thornwood NY</h3>

"Humidifier fever" is a common illness caused by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Various fungis and germs grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these contaminants can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are animals and household plants.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
