<p>Collins Aerospace ventilation systems improve your flight experience by supplying fresh air, improving food safety and cooling your flight-essential and flight-critical electronic devices. An alternative to packaged systems is making use of separate indoor and outside coils in split systems Split systems are preferred and widely utilized worldwide except in North America. In North America, divided systems are most often seen in residential applications, but they are acquiring appeal in little commercial structures.
