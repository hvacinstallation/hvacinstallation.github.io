<h3>Assessing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System in Scottsburg IN</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems need relatively little attention. But, just like any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is essential to keep the system operating smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank need to be checked for leaks, the system needs to be flushed regularly to get rid of tank and collected pollutants (scaling in difficult water locations).

The collector's glass can be washed regularly to eliminate dust gathered in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
