Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
