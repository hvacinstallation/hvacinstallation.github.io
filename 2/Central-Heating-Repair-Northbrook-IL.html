They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat.
