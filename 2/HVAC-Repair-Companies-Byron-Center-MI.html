<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
