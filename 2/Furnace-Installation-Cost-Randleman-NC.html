<p>Geothermal heatpump are exceptionally effective, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a consistent temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just achieve an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling effect.

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Randleman NC</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
