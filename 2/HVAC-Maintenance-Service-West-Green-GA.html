<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, the majority of Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not know why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your issue. If you found that your conditioning filter needs changing, then the next step is to thaw your a/c devices. The simplest method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
