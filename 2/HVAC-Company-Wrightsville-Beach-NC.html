<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation).

<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price great however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
