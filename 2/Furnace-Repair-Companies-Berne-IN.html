<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as an Essential Company in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% efficiency or much better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which may be ranked as low as 80% effectiveness, this can suggest substantial cost savings in annual heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by running at lower or greater capability depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Because of our high requirements for task quality and customer service, the majority of our consumers pertain to us from recommendations - either individual recommendations from friends, or referrals from home builders who trust Bob's Heating & Cooling and suggest us to new property owners.

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it might suck up to twice the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to provide a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed simply a couple of years earlier.<p>
