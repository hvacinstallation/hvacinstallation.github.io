<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth.

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging direct exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is incorrectly gotten rid of from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

Throughout high use months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
