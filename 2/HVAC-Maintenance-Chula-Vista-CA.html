<h3>Tips to Help You Hire Chula Vista CA Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We picked getting something more expensive than a standard water heater as gas is among our most significant utility costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in autos in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC professionals. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by lots of individuals.<p>
