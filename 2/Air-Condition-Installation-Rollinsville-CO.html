<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from items or processes; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
