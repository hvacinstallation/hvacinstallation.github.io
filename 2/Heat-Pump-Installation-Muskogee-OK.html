<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same contaminants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>When trying to figure out how frequently I should replace my air conditioning filters, there are numerous things to take into factor to consider. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has an unique DNA on how it collects dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how typically your cooling filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better best decision on how frequently your HVAC filters require changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less frequently you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with just one air conditioning filter need changing more frequently.<p>

<p>I generally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>We look at clues prior to we provide recommendations to change rather than repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater every year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>We have actually been using Keefe's for several years and have constantly been extremely satisfied. They use exceptional repair install and the customer service is wonderful. We just recently had an issue with an older unit and called to set up a day and time to have it inspected. They sent James Bell and he was great. He put in the time to discuss our options cost distinctions and was extremely educated professional and useful. Pleased clients. " Mathew Licausi.<p>
<p>The predominant health result associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
