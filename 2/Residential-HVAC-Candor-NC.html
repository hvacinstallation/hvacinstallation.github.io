<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce contaminants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
