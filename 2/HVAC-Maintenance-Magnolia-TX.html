<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate.

That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down prior to it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
