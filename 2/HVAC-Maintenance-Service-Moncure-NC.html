<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is utilized to transfer the heat to the spaces. A lot of modern-day warm water boiler heater have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the circulation system (rather than older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air using radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be mounted on walls or set up within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
