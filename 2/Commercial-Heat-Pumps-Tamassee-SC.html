They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
