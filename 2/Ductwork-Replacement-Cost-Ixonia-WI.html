<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. First, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
