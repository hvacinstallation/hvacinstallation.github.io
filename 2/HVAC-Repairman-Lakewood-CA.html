<h3>Air Conditioner Parts in Lakewood CA</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Several initiatives envisage to reduce indoor air contamination by restricting VOC emissions from products. There are guidelines in France and in Germany, and many voluntary ecolabels and rating systems consisting of low VOC emissions requirements such as EMICODE, 19 M1, 20 Blue Angel 21 and Indoor Air Comfort 22 in Europe, along with California Requirement CDPH Section 01350 23 and numerous others in the USA.
