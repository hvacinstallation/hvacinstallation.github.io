<p>A geothermal heating system is more reliable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can just be utilized when there is wind, while solar energy counts on routine sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a dependable and available source of energy.<p>
