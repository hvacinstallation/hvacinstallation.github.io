<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Rockaway NJ</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate since it merely takes more electricity to run a larger system. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off prior to it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
