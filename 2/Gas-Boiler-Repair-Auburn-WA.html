Instead of warming or cooling the air currently inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and pushes it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you might not have a problem as long as your house still heats up to the best temperature level. The temperature of the air produced by the heat pump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel really hot. If your house is not heating up, just be concerned.
