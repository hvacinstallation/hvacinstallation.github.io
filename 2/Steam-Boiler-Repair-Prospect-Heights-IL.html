<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Prospect Heights IL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>When all the jobs have been completed, the last job is to check the system to make sure it cools successfully. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat. This last check may explain faults in the thermostat, which might be as basic as a need to change batteries. A failure to turn on may simply include a tripped circuit breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician talks about any issues or concerns and makes suggestions about upgrades where proper.<p>
