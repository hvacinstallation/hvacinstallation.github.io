<h3>Air Conditioning Installation Cost in Germantown WI</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs between $300 to $500 typically. It's the ductwork that provides cold air to each room in your home, and if it develops fractures which leakage, they require to be fixed. Having defective ductwork makes your system work harder with worse results. Your house will not be sufficiently cooled, and your energy costs will increase. Installing brand-new ductwork for the entire house will cost an average of in between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
