<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate terrific however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
