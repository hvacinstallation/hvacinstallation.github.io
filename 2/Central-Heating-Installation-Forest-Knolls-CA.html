<p>A customized a/c that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard ac system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the same air course. A standard air conditioning system transfers heat out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside. Nevertheless, considering that all components of the dehumidifier remain in the same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is in fact heated, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
