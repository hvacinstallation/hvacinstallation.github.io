<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
