<p>The contaminants noted in this guide have actually been revealed to cause the health results pointed out. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily real that the impacts noted happen at the pollutant concentration levels usually discovered in the home. Oftentimes, our understanding of the contaminants and their health results is too restricted to identify the levels at which the listed impacts could happen.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your house may have bad indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, look for signs of problems with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can indicate your house may not have enough ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, smelly or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To detect smells in your house, action outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
