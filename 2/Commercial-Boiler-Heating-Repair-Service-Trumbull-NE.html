<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives ask for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, a lot of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product.

<p>Great Item! Delivery was sort of weird being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.
