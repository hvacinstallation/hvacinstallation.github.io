<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home residents. Unlike other types of air conditioning unit, evaporative coolers rely on the outdoors air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be allowed to push the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to preserve and comprehend.<p>
