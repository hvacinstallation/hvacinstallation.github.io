<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
