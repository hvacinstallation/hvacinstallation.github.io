Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
