<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
