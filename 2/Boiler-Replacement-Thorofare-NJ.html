One of the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic. The water triggers your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
