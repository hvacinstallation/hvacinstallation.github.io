<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
