<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
