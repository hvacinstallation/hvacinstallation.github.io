<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
