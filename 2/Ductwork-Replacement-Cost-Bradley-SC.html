<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can pay for, many Seattleites should discover ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
