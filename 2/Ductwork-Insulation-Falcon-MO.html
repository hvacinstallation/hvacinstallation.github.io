<p>Research trusted building and improvement companies in your area and deal to be a reliable HVAC resource. Residential and commercial building contractors may be your best long-term leads since they build homes and commercial buildings from the ground up. Restoration task supervisors may desire a HVAC specialist to figure out if a heating or cooling unit should be repaired or replaced.

<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
