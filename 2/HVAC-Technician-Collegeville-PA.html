<p>EHSI's indoor air quality group masters integrating a multidisciplinary technique to indoor air quality (IAQ) difficulties. When estimating the cost of an installation, a safe cost estimate bracket is in between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the type of system you select for your house.

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Underground temperature stays consistent no matter the climate, so geothermal systems offer dependable and constant heating and cooling.<p>
