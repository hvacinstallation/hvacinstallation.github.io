<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heatpump, whatever needs to be replaced ultimately. As equipment ages, it becomes less effective.

<p>A primary factor in the prevention of health symptoms is an effective, correctly designed and operating ventilation system.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
