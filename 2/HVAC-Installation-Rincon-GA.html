<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Rincon GA Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>Hospital running theatres, in which air is filtered to high levels to minimize infection danger and the humidity controlled to restrict client dehydration. Although temperatures are frequently in the convenience range, some expert treatments, such as open heart surgery, need low temperatures (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, relatively high temperatures (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F). In both comfort and procedure applications, the goal might be to not just control temperature level, however also humidity, air quality, and air motion from space to space.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
