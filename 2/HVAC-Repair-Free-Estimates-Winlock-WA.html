<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a business was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
