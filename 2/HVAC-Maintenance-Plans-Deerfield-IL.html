<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

This is usually used in a 2nd or third-floor  area and takes advantage of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>
