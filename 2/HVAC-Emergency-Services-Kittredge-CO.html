<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
