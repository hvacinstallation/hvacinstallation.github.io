<p>All houses need reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from use. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature level. Heaters that kick on often may be due to an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
