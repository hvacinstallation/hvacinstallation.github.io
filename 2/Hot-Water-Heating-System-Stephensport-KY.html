<h3>Facts All Stephensport KY Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
