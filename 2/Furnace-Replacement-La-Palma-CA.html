<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and certifications. A great location to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification.
