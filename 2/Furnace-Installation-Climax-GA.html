<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best feature of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they identified the problem and repaired extremely rapidly.

<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can end up being airborne, and therefore, are easily inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat irritant could cause an asthma attack in people with cat allergic reactions, however not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, but it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have an unfavorable impact on occupants-- outside air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
