<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an abnormally high bill that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had spotted the trouble area in looking over the bill. He resolved the concern in one day, had changed the bill to what I thought about reasonable prior to he recalled, understood what may have caused the issue and had a plan to insure that it would not occur once again. I have actually thought about All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have actually utilized them. This experience validates that.<p>
<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website.

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
