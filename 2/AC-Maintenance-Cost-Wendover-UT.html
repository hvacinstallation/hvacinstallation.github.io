HVAC specialists suggest following this standard rule when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
