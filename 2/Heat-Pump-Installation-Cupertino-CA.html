<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There must not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
