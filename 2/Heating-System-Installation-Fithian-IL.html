<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may go into nearby ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outdoor fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
