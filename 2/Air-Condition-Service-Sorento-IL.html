<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
