<p>Normally the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-efficient method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>Consider possible effects of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit. Follow the maker's directions, specifically instructions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating system properly changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is typically an indication of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While an area heating unit remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heating unit is located to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
