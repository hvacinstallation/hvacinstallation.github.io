<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Essential Business in Los Angeles. Changed to using Wachoff's about a year back and they've been to the house for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced fairly, have actually managed the one repair I required well, and are constantly on-time and professional. Have been through a couple of companies over the years and Wachoff's is certainly the very best I've had the opportunity to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been excellent.<p>

Just be worried if your house is not heating up. However, if your system does not seem working appropriately, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you should contact an expert to repair the unit and examine.<p>

<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
