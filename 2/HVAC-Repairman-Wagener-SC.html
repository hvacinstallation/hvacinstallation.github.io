<p>Info provided in this safety guide is based upon existing clinical and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The standards do not need you to alter your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services must still be offered for your home's systems. The "life-span" of a central air conditioning conditioner is about 15 to 20 years. Producers generally continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance contracts after the new standard enters into effect.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, a professional service individual must be called for nearly any maintenance besides routine cleaning. Central air conditioners should be expertly inspected and adjusted prior to the start of every cooling season. However, do not let your maintenance end with this annual checkup. While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system operating at peak performance.<p>
