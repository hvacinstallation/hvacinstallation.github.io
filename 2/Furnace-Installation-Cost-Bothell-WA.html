<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Bothell WA Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Ensure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The lowered airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
