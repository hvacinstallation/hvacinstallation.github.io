<p>Mentioning air, radiant heating systems tend to enhance indoor air quality. This is because forced air heater circulate air-borne pollutants throughout the house during operation, provoking a variety of different unfavorable results. Radiant heating systems don't flow air at all, which actually improves your indoor air quality by limiting your exposure to high levels of air-borne pollutants.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
