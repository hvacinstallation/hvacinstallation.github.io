<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Sumner IA</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates unpleasant smells and excessive moisture, introduces outside air, keeps interior structure air flowing, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
