<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the a/c unit back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, location 2 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>There are many things to think about when attempting to find out how typically I need to replace my a/c filters.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
