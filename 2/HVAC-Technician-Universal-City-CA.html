<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is a very pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns besides the blower motor.

He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
