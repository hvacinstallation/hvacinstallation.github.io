Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the exact same period. Essentially, SEER supplies more data based on how the EER carries out in different temps. The higher the system's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>
