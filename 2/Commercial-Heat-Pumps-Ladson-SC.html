<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Important Business in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are ranked 90% performance or better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient.

<p>Great contractors use load-calculating software that consider such data as the variety of windows in your home, the thickness of insulation, the setup of the attic, and the structure's orientation to the sun.

All quotes (get at least three, from licensed, well-regarded companies) ought to include this one-page printout.<p>
<p>Whatever heater you set up, it's essential that it's sized properly for your house. Too big and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should.
