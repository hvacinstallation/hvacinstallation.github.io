The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are forced to withstand current, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air.
