<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power should not surpass the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, considering that the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Basically, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not basic, given that it considers not only the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as near to the house as possible per my demand.
