<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
