<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
