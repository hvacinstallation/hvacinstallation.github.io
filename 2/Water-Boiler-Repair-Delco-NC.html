<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

For instance, a heat exchanger may fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature degeneration, resulting in holes and cracks. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the component.  a very useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
