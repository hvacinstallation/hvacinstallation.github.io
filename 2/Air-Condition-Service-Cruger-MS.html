<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
