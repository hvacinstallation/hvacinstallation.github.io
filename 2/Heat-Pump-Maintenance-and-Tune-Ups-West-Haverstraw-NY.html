<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.)

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have issues.
