<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various home effectiveness upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to help us debate which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings.

<p>Both must be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
