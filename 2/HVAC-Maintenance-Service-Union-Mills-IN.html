<p>When installing a wall sensor, consider the height at which they should be put. Many frequently they are mounted at height-level or a little lower, if people mostly remain seated in that specific location. However, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate toward the flooring or ceiling; depending upon what toxin you're trying to track you'll need to place the sensor accordingly. For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the greatest concentrations inside structures are normally near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is much heavier than air and remains near the flooring.<p>

It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing money by not changing the older system.<p>
