<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can afford, many Seattleites need to find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to deal with the reality of a cruel, harsh summer.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they give me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
