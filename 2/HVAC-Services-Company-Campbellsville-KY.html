<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
