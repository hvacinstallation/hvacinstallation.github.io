<p>Selecting the best size a/c unit is an essential part of the HVAC purchasing process and one that you'll require an HVAC professional to assist you with. Here's why purchasing the ideal size a/c unit matters: if you buy an HVAC system that's too huge, you'll wind up wasting cash and energy. And if it's too small, you will not get enough cool or warm air to keep you comfortable.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building regulations most likely specify the amount (and often quality) of outside air that must be continuously supplied in your buildings, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation coupled with correct usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
