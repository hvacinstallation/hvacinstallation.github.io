The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a portion effectiveness rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon maintaining it according to the maker's instructions.<p>
