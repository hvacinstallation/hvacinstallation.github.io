They both did a great job. Sabre's workplace staff is extremely practical, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and supplying the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are also well priced for their services. Absolutely advise.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
