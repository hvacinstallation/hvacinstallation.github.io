<p>At present, EPA does not suggest using air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay products. The efficiency of these devices is uncertain because they only partly eliminate the radon decay products and do not decrease the amount of radon entering the home.

EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, offers additional info on air-cleaning devices to minimize indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that might impact the health of people who live in the home. Pollutants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon going into your house from the ground listed below. An air toxin could also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care items.
