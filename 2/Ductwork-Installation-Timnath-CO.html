<p>The predominant health impact associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
