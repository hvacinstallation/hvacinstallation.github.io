<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather significant.<p>
