Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon.

EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually.
