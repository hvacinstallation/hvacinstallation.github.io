<p>Fantastic Item! Delivery was kind of odd being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was very lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we resolved issues. I would advise this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems.

This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
