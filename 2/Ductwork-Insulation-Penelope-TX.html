<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
