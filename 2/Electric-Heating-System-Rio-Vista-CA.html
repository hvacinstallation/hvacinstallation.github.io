<h3>Truth About Rio Vista CA Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing Waychoff for about 10 years. Initially, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have kept my system semi-annually. Their techs are extremely educated and expert. Expenses are sensible. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff installed a brand-new air handler and condenser this week.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
