<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

<p>Fights the hot days: Though most temperatures in Seattle are acceptably typical, you can expect a minimum of thirty days throughout which temperatures will reach above 80 degrees.

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
