<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, but it is likewise a choice for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, considering that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are typically only available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best option for property owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
