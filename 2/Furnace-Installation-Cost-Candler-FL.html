<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. As soon as the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately solidify and treat-- normally two to four weeks.
