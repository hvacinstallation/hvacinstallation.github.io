<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold may be living in your house's duct, affecting the air you breathe along with the efficiency of your heating and a/c system. There are a number of design methods in usage today; however, all ground source heat pumps run with similar concepts. Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface area units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources likewise determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up frequently, they can end up being clogged with debris that can limit air flow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Dirty filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, examining and changing a furnace filter can normally be performed in just a few minutes, frequently with no tools required. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure.
