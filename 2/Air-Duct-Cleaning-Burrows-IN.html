<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really delighted that someone as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to check the air conditioner before you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to test AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
