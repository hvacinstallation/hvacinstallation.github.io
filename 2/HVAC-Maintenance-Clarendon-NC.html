<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
