<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
