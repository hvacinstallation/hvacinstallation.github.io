<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
