<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
