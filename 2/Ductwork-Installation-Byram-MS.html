<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they identified the problem and repaired very quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as important when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size.
