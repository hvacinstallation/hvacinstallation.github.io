<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Style, Building And Construction and Commissioning is designed for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other specialists worried about indoor air quality. Our professionals explain all of your choices before beginning the repair, so you can choose whether a repair or replacement is best for you.

If you choose that changing your furnace is the very best course of action, we can install a new, high-efficiency model in its location.<p>
<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive.<p>
