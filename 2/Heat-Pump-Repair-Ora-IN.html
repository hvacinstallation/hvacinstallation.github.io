<p>Geographically, some areas pay regularly higher salaries for air conditioning tradespersons. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable climate, or simply a high level of competition for competent trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's greatest average incomes for HVAC specialists at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 per year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually. Massachusetts and Connecticut rounded out the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 each year.<p>
<p>My oldest kid constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think of anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>The predominant health result related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
