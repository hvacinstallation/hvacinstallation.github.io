<p>Aspects that can contribute to the development of biological pollutants are wet or wet building products (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and improperly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and ac system. "Humidifier fever" is a typical illness triggered by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs.

<p>If you discover a decline in heat output, first make sure the air filter is clean and in great condition. Next, check other components of the furnace for any build-up of particles, dirt and dust, an economical repair that can help boost efficiency. Also, inspect the vents and ducts for blockage.

Your thermostat will shut off the furnace too early and leave your home feeling cold if this takes place. You may also need to examine your insulation to make certain that warm air does not leave from your space through numerous openings.<p>
