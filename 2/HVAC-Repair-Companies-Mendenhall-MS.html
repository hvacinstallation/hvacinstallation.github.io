Typically they were at first interested in remotely keeping track of some other aspect of their structures, such as energy use, in an effort to cut costs. It wasn't until later, as they continued working with us, that they learnt more about and implemented indoor air quality keeping track of to offer a much healthier, much safer structure environment-- and to head off the negative consequences related to indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There need to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
