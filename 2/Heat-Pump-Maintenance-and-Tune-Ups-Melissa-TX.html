<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roofing system, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, however it is likewise an alternative for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems include not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, because the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are generally just offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capability.
