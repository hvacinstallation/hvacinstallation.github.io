<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
