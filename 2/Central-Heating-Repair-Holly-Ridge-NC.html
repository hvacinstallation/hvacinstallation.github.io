The company started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for years, till the mandate for high-efficiency units required Goettl to end production. The contracting side of business continued under several owners. Goodrich's father was a Goettl dealer in Las Vegas, so when the opportunity concerned buy what was left of the company in 2013, he took it.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
