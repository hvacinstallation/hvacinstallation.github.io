Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>

<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in Balfour ND</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
