It likewise prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
