<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
