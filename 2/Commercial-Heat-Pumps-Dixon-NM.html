<h3>Central Heating Installation Agency in Dixon NM</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of exchanging or changing air in any area to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of undesirable smells and excessive moisture, presents outside air, keeps interior building air distributing, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
