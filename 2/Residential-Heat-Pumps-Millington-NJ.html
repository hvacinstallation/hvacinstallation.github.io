<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, however a property owner does not have the tools or skills essential to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the needed devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still needed to have an expert technician check the system periodically.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor carefully, much of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales strategies that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
