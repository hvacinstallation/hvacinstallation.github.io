<p>Due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion procedure. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly straightforward process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather pricey.<p>

<p>A geothermal heating system is more reputable than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external factors, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power. For instance, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar energy relies on regular sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, however instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a available and reliable  source of energy.<p>
