<h3>Furnace Company in Clarkton NC</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest won't come on. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic. The water triggers your emergency security switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on rare occasions.<p>
