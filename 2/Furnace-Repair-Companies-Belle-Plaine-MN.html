<p>The EPA and CMHC scientists utilized various methodologies. The CMHC research study called on a number of duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they became part of a research study, and the scientists did not manage for time invested or methods used. The EPA study prescribed and managed approaches used on a smaller variety of houses.

<p>As with most home improvement projects, the cost of a full central heating system can vary widely based on the size of the home. Most heaters will last between 15 and twenty years. In choosing a furnace, property owners need to think about heat output and performance. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A little home, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too quickly and shut off for too long, resulting in irregular temperature level levels.<p>
