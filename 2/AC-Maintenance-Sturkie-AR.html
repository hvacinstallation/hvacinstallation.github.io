<h3>AC Maintenance in Sturkie AR</h3>

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, many of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same).

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which might get in close-by ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
