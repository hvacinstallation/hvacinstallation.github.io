Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely appreciative to have a heated home again. What's most remarkable was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right before a vacation, however Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my friends.<p>
