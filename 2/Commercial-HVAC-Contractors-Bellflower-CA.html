<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered with a Bellflower CA HVAC Company</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes much more extreme with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more standard form of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized rather of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperature levels. In this case, the heatpump is used effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
