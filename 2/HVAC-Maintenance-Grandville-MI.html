<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Grandville MI</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Allergen and mold love wetness. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% assists keep them and other allergens under control. A dehumidifier (and air conditioner during summer months) helps reduce moisture in indoor air and successfully controls irritants, Lang says. An a/c unit also lowers indoor pollen count - another plus for allergic reaction -victims.<p>
<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing material bought with your house. This company presented a service arrangement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the inspection on a very cold day they killed the furnace declaring health danger factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a brand-new homeowner I have learned how to identify the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
