Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is typically difficult to quantify, as one action mentioned the savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not just break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the result of repetitive usage of a part that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature wear and tear, leading to holes and fractures.
