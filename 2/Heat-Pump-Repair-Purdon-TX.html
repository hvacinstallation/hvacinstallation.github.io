<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can often conclude that the capacitor has actually failed. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille.

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
