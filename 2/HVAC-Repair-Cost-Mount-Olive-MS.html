<p>There are a lot of advantages to using a radiant heat system over a traditional forced air heating system. Radiant heating systems tend to be a lot more energy effective than other heaters, for one thing. Forced air heating systems tend to struggle with things like duct leaks, which rob them of as much as 30% of their output. Required air heating systems also tend to generate cold and hot spots throughout your house, due to the nature of how warm air rises to the top of a space and sinks as it cools.<p>

<p>Some health effects may appear shortly after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures to a pollutant. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant impacts are usually short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is simply removing the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined.
