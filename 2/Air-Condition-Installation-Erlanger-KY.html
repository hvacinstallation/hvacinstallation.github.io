So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair.
