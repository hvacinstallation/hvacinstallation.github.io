The efficiency of these gadgets is uncertain because they only partially remove the radon decay items and do not reduce the quantity of radon entering the home. EPA prepares to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a reliable means of minimizing the health danger from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, offers additional information on air-cleaning devices to reduce indoor air contaminants.<p>
