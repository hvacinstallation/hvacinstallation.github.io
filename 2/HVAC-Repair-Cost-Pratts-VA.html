<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>Examine these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2).
