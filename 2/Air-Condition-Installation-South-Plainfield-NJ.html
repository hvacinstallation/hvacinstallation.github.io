<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
