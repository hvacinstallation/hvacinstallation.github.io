<p>When deciding which of the best AC units they ought to set up in their homes, there are a few primary things that homeowners will want to take into consideration.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
