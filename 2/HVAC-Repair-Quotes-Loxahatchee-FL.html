<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2.

<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can manage, so many Seattleites must find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a vicious, harsh summertime.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
