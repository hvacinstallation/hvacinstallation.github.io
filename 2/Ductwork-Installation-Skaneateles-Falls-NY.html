<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the system has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years.
