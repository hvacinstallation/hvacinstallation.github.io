<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Service in Irmo</h2>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace professionals frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Luis, Melissa and Herbert were all an excellent help and extremely expert! Quick reaction time and kept in contact the whole time. Extremely simple financing procedure, exceptional interaction and terrific service! I don't normally do evaluations however this lot earns every star they have. I would suggest them to anybody needing service, repairs or complete replacement. Outstanding job people, maintain the good work.<p>

<p>I have been using them for many years for my services, my own homes and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he assisted me difficulty shoot the problem. He is sincere, reputable, and sensible on cost. It's difficult to discover an honest AC man and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
