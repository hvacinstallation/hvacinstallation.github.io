<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't emit heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur over time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work up until you buy a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
