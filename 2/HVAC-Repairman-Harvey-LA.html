<p>The very first a/c unit and fridges used toxic or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could result in deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Trane central air conditioning conditioners are known for upholding service warranties and provides a basic 10-year service warranty that covers both parts and labor. A Trane XR14 that has a 14 SEER rating in energy efficiency would cost anywhere from $4,800 to $6,800 to install.

<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit toxins.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
