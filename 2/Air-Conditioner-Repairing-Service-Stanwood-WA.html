<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
