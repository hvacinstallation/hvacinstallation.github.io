<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical material with time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
