<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not place the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it since it exhausts warm air out the top. Any airflow constraint will lower the unit's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide must be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
