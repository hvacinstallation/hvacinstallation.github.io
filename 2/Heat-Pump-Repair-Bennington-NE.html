Co2 at levels that are unusually high inside might trigger residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of co2 in the majority of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
