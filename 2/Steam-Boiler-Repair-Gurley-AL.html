<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everyone can manage, a lot of Seattleites must discover methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in huge box shops like Best Buy, package fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle might be the last city in the country to face the truth of a harsh, vicious summer.<p>
<p>As pointed out above, triggering your new under tile floor heater prematurely, before the mortar has cured, can cause the grout to break or to not adhere appropriately, and may void the service warranty of your mortar product. In some testing, even the tile cracked when the system was run prior to the compound had cured. And mortar makers may decline warranty coverage if you do not follow their directions.<p>
