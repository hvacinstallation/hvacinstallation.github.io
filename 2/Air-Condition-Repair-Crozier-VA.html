First, you'll need one that is effectively sized for your house.

This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the ac system into a heat pump While room cooling provides optimum flexibility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is typically more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
