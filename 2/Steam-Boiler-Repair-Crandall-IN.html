<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil.
