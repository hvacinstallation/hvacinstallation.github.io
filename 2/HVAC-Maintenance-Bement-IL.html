<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
