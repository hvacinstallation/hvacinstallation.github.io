<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in home building and construction is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, roofing systems, and floorings. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor pollutants and assists tire them from the home.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
