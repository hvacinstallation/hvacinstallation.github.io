<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't provide agreements.  The so called respectable companies dupe more individuals than the fly by night outfits.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
