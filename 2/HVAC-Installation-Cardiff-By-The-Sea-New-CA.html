<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
