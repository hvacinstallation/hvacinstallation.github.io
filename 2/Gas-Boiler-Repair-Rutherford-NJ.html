Often times, these systems include not just the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those aiming to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, because the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are normally only available for larger houses due to their high power and capability.
