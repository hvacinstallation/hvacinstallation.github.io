<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
