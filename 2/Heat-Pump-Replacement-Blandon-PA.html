<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

If micro-organisms do develop, they may spread throughout the whole office or structure by methods of the ventilation system.<p>
