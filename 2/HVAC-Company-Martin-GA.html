<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Contractor in Martin</h2>

The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather considerable.<p>
