<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to offer heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump While room cooling supplies maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
