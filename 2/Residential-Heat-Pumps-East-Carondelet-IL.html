<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a large central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heatpump operate on electrical power and work like a/c unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heating unit (like a space heating system) with the same amount of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

Throughout the summer season and winter, central air conditioning units and heating systems supply enough cooling and heating power to houses in Redmond. The typical daytime temperature highs range from the low to upper-70s throughout June, July, and August, and when heat waves go through the community, temperature levels will increase to the mid-80s.

<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," listed below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan should spin. If the compressor starts but the fan does not, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Shut down the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan begins. If  it doesn't, you've offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
