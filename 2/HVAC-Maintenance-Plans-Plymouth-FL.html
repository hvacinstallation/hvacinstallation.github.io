<p>Though it may be tough to believe, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are well-known for lowering the air quality in your house, however there are numerous other contaminants that can not only filthy up the air, however cause other health complications.

If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
