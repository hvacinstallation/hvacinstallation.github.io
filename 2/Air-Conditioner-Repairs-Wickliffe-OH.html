<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my real estate clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. He assisted me problem shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again.

<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on website.

I'm likewise impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.

And mortar producers may decline guarantee coverage if you do not follow their instructions.<p>
