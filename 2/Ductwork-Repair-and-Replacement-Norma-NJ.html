<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are primarily biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and therefore, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of feline irritant could cause an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
