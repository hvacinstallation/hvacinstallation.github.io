<p>Similar to the majority of house improvement projects, the cost of a complete central heating unit can differ widely based on the size of the home. Most heaters will last in between 15 and twenty years. In choosing a furnace, property owners need to think about heat output and performance. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A small house, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too rapidly and shut down for too long, resulting in irregular temperature levels.<p>
