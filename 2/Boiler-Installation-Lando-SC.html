<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years ago and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running.
