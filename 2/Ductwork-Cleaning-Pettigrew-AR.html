<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Style, Building and Commissioning is developed for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other professionals worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include building materials, cigarette smoking, household items, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in produced items. For instance, it is used to include permanent-press qualities to clothing and draperies, as an element of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and coating products.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price terrific but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
