<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
