<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
