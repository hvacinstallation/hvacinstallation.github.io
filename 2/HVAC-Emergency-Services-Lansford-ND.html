<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not use auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.

Hope this helps.<p>
