<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives ask for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.

<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
