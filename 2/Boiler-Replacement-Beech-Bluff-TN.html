<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had identified the trouble location in examining the costs. He solved the problem in one day, had adjusted the bill to what I thought about reasonable prior to he called back, understood what may have caused the problem and had a plan to insure that it would not happen once again.
