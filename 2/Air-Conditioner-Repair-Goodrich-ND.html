<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and renovated the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater due to the fact that the professionals thought they simply didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
