<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>We look at clues prior to we offer suggestions to replace rather than repair a heater. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater every year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be squandering money by not changing the older system.<p>

The next step is to thaw your air conditioning devices if you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing.

<p>Most companies utilize 3rd party warranty companies - not YORK. YORK items are backed by some of the best restricted service warranties in the business, including YORK's factory-backed warranty.
