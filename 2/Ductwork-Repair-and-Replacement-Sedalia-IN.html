<h3>Vertical Air Conditioner in Sedalia IN</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
