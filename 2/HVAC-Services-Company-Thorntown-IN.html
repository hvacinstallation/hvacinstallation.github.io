<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Good AC Repair Company in Thorntown IN</h3>
<p>Among the primary factors a furnace will run constantly is since something is unclean or blocked Before attempting to fix any problem, take some time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". Check the furnace blower for obstructing and clean it if the air filter is good to go. Have an appearance at the furnace blower motor and oil it if this does not work. Contact a knowledgeable technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
