<p>It is especially important to take as much of these actions as possible while you are associated with short-term activities that can create high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint removing, heating with kerosene heaters, cooking, or engaging in maintenance and pastime activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding.

<p>Many indoor air toxins originate from the kitchen area. Gas stoves release damaging contaminants, consisting of carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. Even electric burners produce those exact same toxins in lower levels, as well as other particles that can be quickly absorbed into your bloodstream. So, when you're cooking, make sure to turn on your kitchen area vents, or open a window to help filter out the air even more.<p>
<p>Dust and particles don't simply settle in the filters. They can also collect on blowers, moving parts, condensing systems, and other such important aspects of your HVAC system.
