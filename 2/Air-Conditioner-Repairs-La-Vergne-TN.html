<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
