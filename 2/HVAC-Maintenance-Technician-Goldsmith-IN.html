<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
