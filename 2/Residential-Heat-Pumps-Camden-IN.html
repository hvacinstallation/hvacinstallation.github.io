<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
