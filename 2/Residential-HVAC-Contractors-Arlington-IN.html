<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs in between $300 to $500 on average. It's the ductwork that provides cold air to each space in your house, and if it develops cracks which leak, they require to be fixed. Having malfunctioning ductwork makes your system work harder with worse outcomes. Your home will not be adequately cooled, and your energy bills will go up.

<p>A third method to decide whether your house may have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your house.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
