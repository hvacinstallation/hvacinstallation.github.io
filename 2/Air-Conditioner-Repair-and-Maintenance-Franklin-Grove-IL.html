<p>Great Product! Shipment was kind of unusual being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we resolved concerns. I would recommend this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, consider the height at which they ought to be placed.

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.

<p>There is no simple answer, however lots of use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better service.

<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, because the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are usually only offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best option for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
