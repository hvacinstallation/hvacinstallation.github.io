<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly decreases exposure to pollutants during cooking. Improper modification, often shown by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue. Consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns constantly if you purchase a new gas stove or range. Never utilize a gas range to heat your house. When the fireplace is in use, constantly make particular the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>

What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
