Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
