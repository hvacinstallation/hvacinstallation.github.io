Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
