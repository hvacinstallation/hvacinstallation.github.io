<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater because the technicians believed they just didn't seem best and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
