<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
