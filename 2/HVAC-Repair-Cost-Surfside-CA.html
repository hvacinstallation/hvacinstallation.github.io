<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best.

<p>More common in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, oil or electrical power to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in private rooms. All-electric boilers can accomplish up to 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers should attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in Surfside CA</h3>
<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC system is wintry, the evaporator coil is more than likely frozen.

It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioning unit's evaporator coil.<p>

<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Surfside CA</h3>
<p>The rest of the HVAC system also requires to be in top condition for the air conditioner to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which reside inside the home. If the individual parts remain in correct order, the technician can take a look at the ductwork for indications of holes, spaces or extreme dirt. Sealing leaks in ductwork can improve HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and attend to a cooler house in the hot summer.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
