<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to think about. Many times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, considering that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are generally only available for larger houses due to their high power and capability.
