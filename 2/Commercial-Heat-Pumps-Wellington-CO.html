<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might notice moldy or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems.

In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
