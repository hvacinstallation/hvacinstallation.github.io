<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
