We selected getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>

Simply put, in-floor heating systems provide a various mode and level of comfort. And, as various public awareness projects have long reminded us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we may be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn decreasing our energy expenses.<p>
