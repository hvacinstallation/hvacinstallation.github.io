<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All houses need effective ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside offices, schools, and other offices is essential not only for workers' convenience but also for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has actually been connected to signs like headaches, fatigue, trouble concentrating, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Likewise, some specific illness have been linked to specific air pollutants or indoor environments, like asthma with moist indoor environments. In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause instant signs but can result in cancer after several years.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas.
