Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
