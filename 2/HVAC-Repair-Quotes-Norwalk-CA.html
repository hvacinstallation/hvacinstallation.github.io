<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters.
