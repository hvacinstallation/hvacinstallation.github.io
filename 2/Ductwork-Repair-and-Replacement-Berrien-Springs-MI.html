<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller home, which will impact installation expenses. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

If your technician finds that your air ducts have substantial mold, dust, dirt, and other contaminants or a moldy smell, they might recommend duct cleaning This is particularly crucial if someone in your family has asthma, allergic reactions, or other signs that may be connected to indoor air pollution.<p>

To avoid CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
