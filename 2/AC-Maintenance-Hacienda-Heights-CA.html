<h3>Heating Strategies For Gas Home Furnaces at Hacienda Heights CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in vehicles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC professionals. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by lots of people.<p>
