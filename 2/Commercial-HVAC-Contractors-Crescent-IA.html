<p>All houses require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the proper temperature. Heaters that kick on regularly may be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
