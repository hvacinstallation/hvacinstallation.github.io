<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the system has actually been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
