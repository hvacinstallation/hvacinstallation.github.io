<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a referral in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
