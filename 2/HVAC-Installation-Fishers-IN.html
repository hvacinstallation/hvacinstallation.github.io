<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
