<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Since it tires warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it. Any air flow constraint will reduce the unit's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
