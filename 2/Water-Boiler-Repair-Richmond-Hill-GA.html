<p>Chemical contaminants: Unpredictable natural compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds.

Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Attempt a various dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
