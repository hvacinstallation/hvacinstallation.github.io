<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
