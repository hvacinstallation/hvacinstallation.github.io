<p>The exhaust outlets permit all hazardous gases to escape your home so there's no dangerous accumulation of carbon monoxide gas and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are clogged, they can lead to a harmful build-up and jeopardize your safety.

They will look for indications of deterioration, leakages, and back draft and repair the issue during their maintenance runs.<p>
