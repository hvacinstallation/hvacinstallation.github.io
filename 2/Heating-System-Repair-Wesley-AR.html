<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heating unit, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by distributing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>It is not recommended that "routine" occupational direct exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to determine if the basic indoor air quality fulfills a particular requirement.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The objective is to supply sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
