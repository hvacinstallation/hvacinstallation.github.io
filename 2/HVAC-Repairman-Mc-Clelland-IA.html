<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very happy that somebody as experienced as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to check the air conditioner prior to you buy.

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
