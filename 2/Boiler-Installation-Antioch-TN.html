<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a circulation system. Metal pipelines are seldom used due to long-term destructive concerns. Virtually all hydronic radiant flooring heat systems today utilize 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is extremely versatile, won't rust and can be found in long lengths, which allow PEX pipe to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
