<p>The main reason homeowners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the quantity of services provided. If the system is brand-new and still under a manufacturer's warranty, the cost might not be worthwhile. Any significant repairs need to be covered under the maker's warranty.

<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, however it is also a choice for property owners to think about. Often times, these units include not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, since the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are generally just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a great way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
