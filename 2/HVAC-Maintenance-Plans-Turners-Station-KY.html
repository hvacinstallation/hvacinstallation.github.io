<h3>Boiler Maintenance at Turners Station KY - Reasons Why You Would Have to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
