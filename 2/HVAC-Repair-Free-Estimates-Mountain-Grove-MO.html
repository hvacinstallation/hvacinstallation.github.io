<p>Having a wood-burning heating system can be very effective in terms of cost. If you have access to free or cheap fire wood, or you cut your own wood from your woodlot, it may not cost you anything at all.

Wood-burning heat systems may not be fantastic for the environment in spite of being carbon neutral since of the quantity of wood required to effectively heat your entire house.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
