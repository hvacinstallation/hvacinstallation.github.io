<p>Expert heater installations. However, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately stop working. HVAC professionals suggest following this fundamental guideline when choosing whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a new system, it's finest to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single see, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance gos to each year, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and typically some other advantages. Some companies provide top priority appointments to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
