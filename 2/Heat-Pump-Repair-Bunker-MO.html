<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ may observe unpleasant or moldy odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
<p>As pointed out above, activating your new under tile floor heating unit prematurely, prior to the mortar has cured, can cause the grout to crack or to not adhere correctly, and may void the guarantee of your mortar product. In some testing, even the tile broken when the system was run before the substance had cured. If you do not follow their guidelines, and mortar makers may refuse guarantee coverage.<p>
