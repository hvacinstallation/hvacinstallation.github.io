<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
