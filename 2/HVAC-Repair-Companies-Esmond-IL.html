<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract..
