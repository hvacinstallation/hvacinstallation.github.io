<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
