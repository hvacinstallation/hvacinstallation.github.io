<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing in Irvington AL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<h3>HVAC Services Company in Irvington AL</h3>
<p>I have been using them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, trustworthy, and sensible on rate. It's hard to find an honest AC guy and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of symptoms in numerous thousands of asthmatic kids, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes eye, throat, and nose irritation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked direct exposure to pre-owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place in time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is unclean, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be working at optimum performance and might overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, producing a cycle that does not end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy costs to rise. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not huge enough for your home. If the system is too little, it will have to work harder and may overheat. Normally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>
