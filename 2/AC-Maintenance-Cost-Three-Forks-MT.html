<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being airborne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat allergen could bring on an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
