What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
