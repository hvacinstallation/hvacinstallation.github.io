<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

If you observe the advancement of any irregularities with your air conditioning system, call the AC repair specialists at Integrity Energy Systems for reliable repairs made with the knowledge your a/c requirements. Call us today and believe in your air conditioning unit all summertime long.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract attempts to upsell you every time they concern carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400?

She didn't need a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
