<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
