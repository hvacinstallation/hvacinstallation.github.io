<p>A/c producers typically make rugged, high quality items. If your air conditioning unit fails, start by checking any fuses or circuit breakers. Let the unit cool down for about five minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch may have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, situated in the compressor's gain access to panel.<p>
