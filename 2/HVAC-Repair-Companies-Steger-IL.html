<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ may see undesirable or musty smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues.
