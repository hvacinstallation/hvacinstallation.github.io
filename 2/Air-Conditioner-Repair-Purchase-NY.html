Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is actually heated up, simply as by an electric heater that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
