<h3>HVAC Contractors Near Me in Lake Zurich IL</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
