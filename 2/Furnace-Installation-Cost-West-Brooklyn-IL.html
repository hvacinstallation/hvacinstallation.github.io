<p>Info supplied in this security guide is based on present clinical and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Buildings continuously evolve as an outcome of the modifications in the environment around them along with the residents, products, and activities within them. The various surface areas and the air inside a building are constantly engaging, and this interaction results in changes in each.

<p>The very first a/c unit and fridges employed flammable or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
