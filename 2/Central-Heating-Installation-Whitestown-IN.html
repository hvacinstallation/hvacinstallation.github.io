<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad.

A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively.

A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the system has been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
