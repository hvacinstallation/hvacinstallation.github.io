<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor carefully, many of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
