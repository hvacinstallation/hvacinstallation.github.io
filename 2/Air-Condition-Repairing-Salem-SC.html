<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Companies in Salem</h2>

<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Salem SC</h3>
<p>Home convenience is a crucial topic for many people, and it's never ever more obvious than if your furnace stops working on a cold winter night.

The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins but the fan doesn't. Shut down the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan begins. If  it does not, you have actually offered it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
