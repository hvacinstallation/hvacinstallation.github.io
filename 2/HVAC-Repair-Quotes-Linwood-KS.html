<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my services, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again. He is sincere, trustworthy, and affordable on price. It's tough to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
