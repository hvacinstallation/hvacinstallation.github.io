<p>Great Product! Delivery was type of odd being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was very lite weight and requires time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we solved issues. I would suggest this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the very first time.
