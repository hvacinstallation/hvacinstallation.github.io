I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
