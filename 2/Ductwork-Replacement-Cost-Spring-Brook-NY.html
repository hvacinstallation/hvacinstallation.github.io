<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

If you've set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
