<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>We have actually been exceptionally pleased with Integrity's equipment (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten completed annual maintenance of our system). Trane heat pump has actually worked extremely well and is so efficient that it significantly lowered our utility costs - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years. The couple of times we have needed them for emergencies they reacted quickly and solved the problem.<p>
