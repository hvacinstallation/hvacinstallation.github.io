<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which might enter nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
