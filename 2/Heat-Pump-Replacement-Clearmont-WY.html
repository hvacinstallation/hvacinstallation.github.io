<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
