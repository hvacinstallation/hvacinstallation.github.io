<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
