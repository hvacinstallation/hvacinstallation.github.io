<p>Though it may be tough to think, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for decreasing the air quality in your house, however there are lots of other pollutants that can not only dirty up the air, but cause other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and building materials add to poor air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unstable organic substances) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, but many use the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a much better service. If the current system has not sustained other significant repairs, is in otherwise excellent condition, and issues that caused the breakdown can be recognized and fixed, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense also.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the US your house is located, the local area's environment can change drastically. A home situated in the South would need an AC unit with a size capable of cooling your house due to high temperature Summers. A home in the Northern part of the United States would need a much larger heating capability as well which will impact costs. See the chart below for the typical central air conditioner replacement expenses by HEAPS.<p>
