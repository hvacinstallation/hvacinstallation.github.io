<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There need to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
