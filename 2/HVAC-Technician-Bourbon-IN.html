<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
