<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall.

Ductless heat pumps are great for additions since they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up.

Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>
