<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

They consist of hold-ups in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems.
