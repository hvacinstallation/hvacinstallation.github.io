<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the task based only on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex effectively advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install group was considerate of my home and installed the devices in the expected amount of time. post set up examination results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 heap R22 unit it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
