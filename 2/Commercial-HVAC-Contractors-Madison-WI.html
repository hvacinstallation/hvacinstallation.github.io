<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
