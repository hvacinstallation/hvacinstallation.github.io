<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as a car radiator or normal home ac system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>
