<h3>Gas Central Heating in Hodgen OK</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle a/c unit".

When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Heat pumps are a dream become a reality for folks in Seattle. Cooling is something that most Seattleites will only use moderately, but since heatpump can provide both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the best of both worlds!
