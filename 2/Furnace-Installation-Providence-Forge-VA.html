<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractor in Providence Forge</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
