<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Forsyth MO</h3>
<p>New heaters are considerably more efficient than those of 10 or more years ago, cutting costs by as much as 30%. To get repair-free and long-lasting performance from your brand-new system, appropriate installation is a requirement.

Our NATE-certified technicians will appropriately fit your equipment to match your size requirements, installation area, and ductwork. Your current furnace may not be the ideal size to fit your requirements. Many older heating systems are far larger than necessary. An extra-large furnace will regularly cycle on and off, causing the heat exchanger to heat up and cool down. This process can cause cracks in the heat exchanger, compromising safe operation.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs.
