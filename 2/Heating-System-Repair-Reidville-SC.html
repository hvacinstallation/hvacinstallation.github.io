Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate issues, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
