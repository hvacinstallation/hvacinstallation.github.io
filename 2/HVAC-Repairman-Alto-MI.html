<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were great! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested. They satisfied my needs completely by offering an expert quote with options, without pressing additional products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also quickly followed up with the required evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
