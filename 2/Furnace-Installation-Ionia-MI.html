<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Ionia MI</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
