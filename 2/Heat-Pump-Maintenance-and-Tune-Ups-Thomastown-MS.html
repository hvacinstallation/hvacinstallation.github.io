<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Because it merely takes more electricity to run a larger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely useful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to briefly manage the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day.
