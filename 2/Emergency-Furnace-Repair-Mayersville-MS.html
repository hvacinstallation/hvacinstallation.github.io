There are many methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. When a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead goes into the body. Before it was understood how hazardous lead could be, it was used in paint, fuel, pipes, and many other products.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are especially at danger. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in numerous countless asthmatic kids, and may cause countless nonasth-matic children to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition intensified by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke causes nose, throat, and eye inflammation.
