<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
