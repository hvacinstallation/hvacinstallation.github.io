Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in huge box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in floor screens.

To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator requires handled by experts, go to Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
