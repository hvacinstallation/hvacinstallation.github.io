<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps at Montpelier VA</h3>
<p>The types of heating ventilation and cooling (HVAC) systems are as various as the various houses they serve (single household homes, duplexes, mobile houses, houses, high-rise condos, row real estate, and so on). No matter what the type of home HVAC system, appropriate air circulation (ventilation), proper filtering, and humidity manage all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will guarantee that it is running safely and not contributing to or triggering an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
