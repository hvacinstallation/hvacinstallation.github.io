<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Lacey Spring VA</h3>

Their techs are professional and very knowledgeable. Costs are reasonable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff installed a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. Because the cost was undoubtedly sensible, I did not trouble to get rival's quotes since of my rely on Waychoff.<p>
<p>Check these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
