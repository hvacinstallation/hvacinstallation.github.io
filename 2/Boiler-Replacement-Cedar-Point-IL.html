<h3>Air Condition Repair in Cedar Point IL</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
