<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they use air to exchange heat, in the very same method as an automobile radiator or common home air conditioning system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>

The ventilation, air and heating conditioning company tends to run hot and cold.
