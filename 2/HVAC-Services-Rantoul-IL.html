<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
