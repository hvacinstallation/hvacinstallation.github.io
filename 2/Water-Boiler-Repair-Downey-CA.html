<p>Advanced ventilation systems that make it possible for greater air flow from the outside, air quality tracking platforms and sensing units, and brand-new air purification technologies are ending up being more common as available solutions in commercial and residential HVAC item packages. Adoption of these innovations, nevertheless, has not been prevalent, as consumers stay largely oblivious to the effects of air quality on health and performance.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ may notice undesirable or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>
