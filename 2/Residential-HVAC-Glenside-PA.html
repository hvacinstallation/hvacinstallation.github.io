<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller home, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
