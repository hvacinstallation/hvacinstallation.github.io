<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
