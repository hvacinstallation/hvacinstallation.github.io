Throughout use, there is a time delay while heat is being transported from the heating unit to the home.<p>

The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year.

<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't produce heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.
