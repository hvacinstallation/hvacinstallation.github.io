<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
