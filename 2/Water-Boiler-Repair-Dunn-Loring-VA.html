<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems at Dunn Loring VA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your air conditioner and heat pump must be devoid of all clogs and particles.

Excess moisture can cause issues like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the property, unequal temperature guideline, bacteria, and compromised air quality. A professional maintenance technician will flush and clean the condensate drain to make sure all excess moisture streams away from the system.<p>
