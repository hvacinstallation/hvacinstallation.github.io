<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer.

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
