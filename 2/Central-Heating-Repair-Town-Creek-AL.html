<h3>Working of a HVAC System at Town Creek AL</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing trend in house building and construction is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofs, floors, and walls. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
