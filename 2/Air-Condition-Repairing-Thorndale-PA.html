<p>In addition, worker health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, irritation, and irregular breathing may be caused as the outcome of temperature level extremes, incorrect humidity levels, and too much or too little air blood circulation. Work environment temperature levels ought to be preserved between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by excessive air flow ought to be avoided.<p>
<p>The primary reason homeowners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services offered. The cost may not be worthwhile if the system is brand-new and still under a producer's service warranty. Any significant repairs need to be covered under the producer's guarantee. Nevertheless, some manufacturers need routine maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is frequently crucial to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can sometimes be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping track of information is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent must ask for that the employer have air tracking tests conducted. Evaluation of this data may determine potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are very low, monitoring data might not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
