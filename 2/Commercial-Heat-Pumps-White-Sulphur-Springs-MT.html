<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
