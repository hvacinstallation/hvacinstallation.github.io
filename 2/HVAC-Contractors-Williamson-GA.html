<h3>Furnace Repair in Williamson GA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Immediate impacts might appear after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant impacts are treatable and generally short-term. Often the treatment is just eliminating the individual's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Symptoms of some illness, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also appear right after exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>

If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil.
