<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.  Secondly like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
