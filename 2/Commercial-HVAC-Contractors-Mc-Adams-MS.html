<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)
