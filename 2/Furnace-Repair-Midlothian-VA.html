<p>When our furnace was dying, we contacted 2 local companies for bids. While both were helpful and useful, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a much better deal, for remarkable service. Instead of a basic sales task, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heater and located ways we might have more even heat. He included these minor however considerable changes in his quote. We decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump due to the fact that of recent warmer summers and for environmental factors.<p>
<p>We have been incredibly pleased with Integrity's equipment (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten completed annual maintenance of our system). Trane heatpump has worked extremely well and is so efficient that it substantially minimized our energy expenditures - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years. The few times we require them for emergencies they responded quickly and resolved the issue.<p>
