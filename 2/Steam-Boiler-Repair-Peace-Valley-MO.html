<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Make sure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>

If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
