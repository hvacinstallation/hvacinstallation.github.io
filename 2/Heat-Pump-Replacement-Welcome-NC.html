<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, since a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>

Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
