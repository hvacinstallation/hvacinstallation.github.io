<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
