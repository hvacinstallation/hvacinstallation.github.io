<p>The function of a lot of structure ventilation systems is to generate adequate fresh air for resident comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing security at sensible energy expenses. Load determining is referred to as the Handbook J computation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or system cost for air conditioning. If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based upon experience or on square video footage alone, transfer to another contractor. Similar to measuring the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, determining the proper size of system for your house also depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
