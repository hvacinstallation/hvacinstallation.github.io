<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
