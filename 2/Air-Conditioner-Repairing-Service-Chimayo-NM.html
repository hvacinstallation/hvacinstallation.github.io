<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Specialist heating system installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately stop working. HVAC experts recommend following this standard guideline when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have a problem as long as your home still heats to the ideal temperature. The temperature of the air produced by the heat pump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel very hot. If your home is not heating up, only be concerned. Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working properly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you need to contact a professional to check and repair the system.<p>
