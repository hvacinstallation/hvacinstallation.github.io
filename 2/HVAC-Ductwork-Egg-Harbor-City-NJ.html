<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold.

Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
