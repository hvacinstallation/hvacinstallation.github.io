<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide automobile debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There ought to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Kenly NC</h3>
<p>Before you select a contractor, think about quotes from at least 3 to five credible contractors. Check with your state's contractor's licensing board online to make sure that no customer grievances have been submitted and that the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is active and valid. Compare the various furnace effectiveness rankings advised by the private contractors to select the design and system that best matches your energy needs. Remember that energy-star ranked equipment will save you cash in the end however might include a higher up-front cost.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a tube twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
