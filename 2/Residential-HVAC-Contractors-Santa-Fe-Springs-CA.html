There are several style approaches in usage today; however, all ground source heat pumps operate with similar concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface area units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump work on electricity and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like a space heating unit) with the exact same quantity of electrical energy. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit.
