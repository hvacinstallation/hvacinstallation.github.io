<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Indoor air contamination is brought on by burning solid fuel sources - such as firewood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. Natural gas. is utilized in countless houses worldwide. Using a gas furnace in your home or office can assist you save cash, enhance energy performance, and uniformly heat your area, to name a few benefits. While a natural gas furnace may be more pricey in the start, you will save cash in the long-term as a result of lower fuel expenses and improved energy performance. A natural gas furnace will generally reach your wanted temperature level in less time than an electric alternative, which will lead to significant energy savings with time. This capability to rapidly reach your wanted temperature level will also enhance your comfort level.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>If no contaminant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. Stagnant air might also be a problem when ventilation is not adequate to account for an increase in the number of employees in the area.<p>
<p>Some health impacts may appear quickly after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures to a pollutant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant results are treatable and normally short-term. In some cases the treatment is merely eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized.

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard job that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps people working. When a sales man concerns your house he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and must not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I give you the alternatives for your needs and you decide if you require it.<p>
