<h3>Types of HVAC Repairs in Livingston MT</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in house construction is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in floorings, roofs, and walls. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air assists and dilutes indoor contaminants tire them from the home.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<h3>Furnace Company in Livingston MT</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
