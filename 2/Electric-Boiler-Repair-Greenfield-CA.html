<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook stoves, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices must be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of products of insufficient combustion.
