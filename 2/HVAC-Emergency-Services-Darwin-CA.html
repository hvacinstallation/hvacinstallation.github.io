<p>Both should be kept clean because an air conditioner moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to routinely clean up the condenser coil.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce contaminants.)
