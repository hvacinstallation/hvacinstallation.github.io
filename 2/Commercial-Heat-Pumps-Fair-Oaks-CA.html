<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.
