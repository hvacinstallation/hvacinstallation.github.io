Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay.

Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to build business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't completion objective.

My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
