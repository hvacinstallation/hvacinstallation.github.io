<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace professionals frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a business was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion objective. HVAC business owners need to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the very same in all other areas.<p>
