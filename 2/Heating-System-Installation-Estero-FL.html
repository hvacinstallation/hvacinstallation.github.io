<h3>Blocked Vents Repair in Estero FL</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the see. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working.

<p>One of the primary factors a furnace will run constantly is since something is filthy or clogged up Prior to trying to fix any problem, take time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". Check the furnace blower for clogging and tidy it if the air filter is good to go. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it. If you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running, contact an experienced technician.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it really quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
