<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, since a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works however your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
