<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Company in Lenexa</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold may be residing in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current study by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground. But a lot of the important things individuals do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne impurities in their homes and intensify asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built.
