<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

Air pressure distinctions developed by these forces move air-borne contaminants from areas of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any available opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move until the within pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
