<h3>Electric Heating Systems in West Townsend MA</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your cooling system from flooding. One of the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on rare celebrations.<p>
