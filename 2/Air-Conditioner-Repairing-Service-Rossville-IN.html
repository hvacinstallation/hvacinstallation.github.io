<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
