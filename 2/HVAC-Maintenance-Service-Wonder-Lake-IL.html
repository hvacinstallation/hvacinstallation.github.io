In addition, some exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not trigger immediate symptoms but can cause cancer after several years.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated effectiveness advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions because they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be set up.
