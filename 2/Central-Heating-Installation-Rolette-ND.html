Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they offer me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in cars in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by numerous people.<p>
