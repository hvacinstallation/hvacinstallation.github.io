<p>Mentioning air, radiant heating systems tend to improve indoor air quality.

Radiant heat systems do not circulate air at all, which really enhances your indoor air quality by limiting your direct exposure to high levels of airborne impurities.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works but your home does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
