<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
