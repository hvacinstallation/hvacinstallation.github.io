<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
