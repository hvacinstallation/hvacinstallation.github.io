<p>If you require furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to order it. My other half stated that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good individuals I have actually fulfilled in a very long time.
