<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you must inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
