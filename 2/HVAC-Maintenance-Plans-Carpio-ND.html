<p>I have been using them for years for my organisations, my own homes and my real estate customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he recommended me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is truthful, dependable, and sensible on cost. It's hard to find a sincere AC person and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
