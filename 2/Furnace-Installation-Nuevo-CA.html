<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
