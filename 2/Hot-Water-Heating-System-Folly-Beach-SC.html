<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had identified the difficulty location in looking over the bill. He resolved the concern in one day, had actually changed the expense to what I considered reasonable before he called back, knew what may have triggered the problem and had a plan to insure that it would not take place again.
