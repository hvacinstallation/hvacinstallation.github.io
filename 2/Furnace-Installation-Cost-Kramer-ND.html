<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater need reasonably little attention. However, as with any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is essential to keep the system operating efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank must be looked for leaks, the system must be flushed regularly to get rid of tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in hard water areas). The systems need to be checked at least two times each year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed periodically to get rid of dust gathered in order to improve collector efficiency.<p>

<p>This is particularly notable, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
