<p>A 3rd method to choose whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, search for signs of issues with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can show your house might not have sufficient ventilation include wetness condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or foul-smelling air, filthy central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being moldy. To detect smells in your house, action outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to supply sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
