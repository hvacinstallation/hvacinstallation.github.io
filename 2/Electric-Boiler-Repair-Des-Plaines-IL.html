<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a company was for financial flexibility.
