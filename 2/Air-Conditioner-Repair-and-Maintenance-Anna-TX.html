<p>They were fantastic! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They met my needs entirely by providing an expert quote with choices, without pressing additional products. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise promptly followed up with the needed examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to preserve the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, many of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Think about possible effects of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system.

While an area heating unit remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>
