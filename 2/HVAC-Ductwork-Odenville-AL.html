<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product gradually.
