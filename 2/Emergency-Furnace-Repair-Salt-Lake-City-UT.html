<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same. When the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively cure and harden-- usually two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
