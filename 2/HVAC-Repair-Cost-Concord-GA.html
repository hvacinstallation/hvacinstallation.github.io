<p>Central air conditioning conditioners are more efficient than space air conditioners. In addition, they run out the way, peaceful, and convenient to run. To save energy and cash, you must try to buy an energy-efficient ac system and reduce your central air conditioner's energy use.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
