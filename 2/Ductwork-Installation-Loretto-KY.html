<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heat pumps work on electrical power and work like a/c unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heater (like an area heater) with the exact same amount of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's most likely your issue.
