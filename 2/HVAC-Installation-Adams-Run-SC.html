<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Adams Run SC</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was really happy they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be using them again.<p>

<p>Outdoor contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Professionals recommend utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller particles and normally are more appropriate for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
