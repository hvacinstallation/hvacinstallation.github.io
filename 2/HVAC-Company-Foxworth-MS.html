<h3>Heat Pump Cost in Foxworth MS</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be using them again.<p>

<p>Because they get rid of moisture from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate problems, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
