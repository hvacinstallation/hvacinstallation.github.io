<p>Many individuals ignore the level of the indoor air contamination problem. Air contamination is generally envisioned as the black smoke produced from factories. Little thought is offered to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, paints, pesticides, and cleaners utilized in the house. To compound the issue, it is estimated that the average American invests 70 percent to 90 percent of his/her time indoors, and more than half that time is spent in the home.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil heating systems are gas heaters While oil is generally used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have a choice in between the two types. Gas furnaces cost about the same, approximately $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real benefit of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home.
