<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Rudy AR?</h3>
<p>Even newer heating systems less than 5 years of ages have been found as bad. A lot of property owners are stunned to find out that their 'new' furnace has a cracked heat exchanger. Sometimes it is due to poor furnace design, however in a lot of cases, it's from overlook.

The Performance Check-Up (see previous answer above) is also crucial to your furnace's life expectancy.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
