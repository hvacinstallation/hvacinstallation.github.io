<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can manage, many Seattleites need to find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in flooring display screens. Seattle might be the last city in the country to deal with the reality of a harsh, harsh summertime.<p>
