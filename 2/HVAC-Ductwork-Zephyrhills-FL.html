<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating unit, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles.

There can be a serious danger from the cumulative effects of these sources. Luckily, there are actions that most people can take both to decrease the risk from existing sources and to avoid new problems from occurring.

<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
