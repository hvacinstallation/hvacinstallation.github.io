<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
