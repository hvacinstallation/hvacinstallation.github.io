The efficiency of these devices doubts because they just partially eliminate the radon decay products and do not diminish the amount of radon entering the house. EPA plans to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or might become, a trusted means of decreasing the health threat from radon. EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers further information on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air contaminants.<p>
