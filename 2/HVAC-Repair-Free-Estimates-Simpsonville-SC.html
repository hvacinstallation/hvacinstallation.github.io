<p>A geothermal heatpump is among the most energy effective techniques of heating or cooling a home. Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a house can be warmed in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels discovered just a few feet below ground. In the summertime, the process reverses, therefore cooling a house by removing heat. Underground temperature remains continuous no matter the climate, so geothermal systems provide constant and trustworthy cooling and heating.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating system is more reliable than options, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar energy. For instance, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar energy depends on regular sunshine to work efficiently. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and reputable  source of energy.<p>
