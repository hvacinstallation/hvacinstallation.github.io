<p>Particular instant results resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently challenging to identify if the signs are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air pollution.

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
