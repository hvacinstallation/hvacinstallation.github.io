<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system increase. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
