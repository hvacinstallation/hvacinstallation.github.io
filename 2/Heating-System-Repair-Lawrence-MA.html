<h3>Gas Central Heating in Lawrence MA</h3>
<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor.

<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
