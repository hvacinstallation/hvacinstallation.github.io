<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most affordable. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot next to the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your home escape out of the window. Convected heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the room with no cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated up.<p>
