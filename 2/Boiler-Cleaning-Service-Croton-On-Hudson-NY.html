<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter.
