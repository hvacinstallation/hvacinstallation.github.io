How do I know. I now work as a consultant to verify the so called issues and solutions. 9 out of 10, I inspect are completely incorrect.<p>

<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Vendor AR</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
