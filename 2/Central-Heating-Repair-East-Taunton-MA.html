<p>Though it might be hard to believe, the air inside your home can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for decreasing the air quality in your house, but there are many other toxins that can not only dirty up the air, but result in other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and structure products add to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unpredictable organic compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery materials can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>To start, it's a great idea to consider energy performance. By selecting a central AC unit that has as high of a performance rating as possible, you can minimize your carbon footprint and conserve cash in the long run. Effectiveness scores should be labeled with all systems. While effective units might cost more, opting for an Energy Star-rated device is a terrific method to take pleasure in additional assurance.<p>
