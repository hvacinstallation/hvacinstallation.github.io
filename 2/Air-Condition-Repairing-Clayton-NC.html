<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>My oldest son always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it truly didnÃ¢ $ t disperse air like it did before. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t really consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is low and itÃ¢ $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
