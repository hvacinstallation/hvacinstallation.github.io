<h3>Truth All Homeowners Must Know About HVAC Installation in New Hope PA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely pleased that someone as knowledgeable as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the ac system prior to you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to check AC systems even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to appropriately service and the unit has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
