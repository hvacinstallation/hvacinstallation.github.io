<p>My eldest kid constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is low and itâ $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least once a week, and 34 percent usage candles or incense that frequently, our nationally representative survey found.
