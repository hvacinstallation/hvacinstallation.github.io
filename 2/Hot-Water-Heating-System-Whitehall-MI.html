<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
