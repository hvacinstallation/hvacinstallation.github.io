<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals used in the building or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems installed to eliminate products of incomplete combustion.
