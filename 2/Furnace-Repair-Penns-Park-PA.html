<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. When the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly solidify and treat-- typically 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
