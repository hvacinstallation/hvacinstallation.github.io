Sealing leaks in ductwork can improve HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler home in the hot summertime.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can pay for, a lot of Seattleites must discover methods to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
