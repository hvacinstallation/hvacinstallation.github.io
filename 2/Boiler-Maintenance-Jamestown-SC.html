<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
