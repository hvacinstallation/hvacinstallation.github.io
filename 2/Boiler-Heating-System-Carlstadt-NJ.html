<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. When the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly harden and treat-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
