<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
