<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor system instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality issues are not limited to homes. In truth, many office buildings have significant air contamination sources Some of these buildings might be inadequately aerated. For instance, mechanical ventilation systems may not be developed or run to supply appropriate quantities of outdoor air.
