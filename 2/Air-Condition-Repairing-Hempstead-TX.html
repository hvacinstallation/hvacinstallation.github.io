<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, but it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
