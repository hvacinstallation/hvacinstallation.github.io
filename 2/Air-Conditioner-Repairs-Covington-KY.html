<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Power Vac America provides commercial, industrial, institutional, marine and residential duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning company. The key part of your air conditioning is the outside unit. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending on its placement on your property and its upkeep, it might sustain some damage throughout the winter season. Most of the time, this simply includes some accumulation of dirt and particles, which is pretty easy to eliminate. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will wipe the outside of the unit and ensure that there is no rust, damage from accumulated wetness, or excessive wear to the outside. They might advise that you trim back overgrown trees or bushes to make sure sufficient airflow around the system.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
