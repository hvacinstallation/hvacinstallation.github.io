<p>. Prior to selecting the installation location of air conditioner, numerous main aspects require to be thought about. First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor systems ought to not fall on the location of rest or workspace. Second of all, there must not be any obstacles on the way of the airflow that may prevent it from covering the area of the properties as much as possible. The outdoor system needs to likewise be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be efficiently released outdoors and the efficiency of the entire system will drop dramatically.
