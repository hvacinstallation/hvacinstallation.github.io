<p>The most common kind of home heating unit in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With a typical cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least costly alternative, but more recent systems can be really energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems generally achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, extremely effective natural gas heating systems can achieve AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is often important to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such details can sometimes be obtained by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If monitoring information is not available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent must request that the employer have air tracking tests conducted. Evaluation of this data might determine possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on data may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
