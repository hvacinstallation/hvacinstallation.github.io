<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Newhebron MS</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>There are numerous variables that contribute to indoor air pollution. Such aspects consist of the use of chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furnishings; carbon monoxide gas released by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls consisted of in electrical transformers; radiation from building insulation; ozone from copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
