<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Burrel CA?</h3>
<p>Sean was very useful. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. When the belt that links the motor to the blower slips, screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler normally occur. Most of the times, the belt is poorly aligned or used and needs replacement. Follow the guidelines above under A/c unit Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's handbook.<p>
