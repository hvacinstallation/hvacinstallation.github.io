<p>Prior to you head out and purchase an a/c unit, there are a few things to choose initially. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioner? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioner be? Too large and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning system and shorten its life. Too little and your air conditioning system will not be able to cool the house appropriately. When shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are just a few of the factors that you need to take into account. Each choice can and will substantially impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't manage to ignore any of them.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ might see unpleasant or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk with your physician about them. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
<p>In this section, you'll go into greater detail about your company.
