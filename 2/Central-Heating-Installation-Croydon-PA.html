<p>Today, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold might be living in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the effectiveness of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Customer Reports National Research Center.
