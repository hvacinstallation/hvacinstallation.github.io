<h3>Is Your Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Dandridge TN?</h3>
<p>After living in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the a/c. I went on and purchased this Carrier and I need to state it does the job quite well. It takes extremely little time to heat up or cool down the house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had in the past. The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not provide them.. Second of all like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the system has been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
