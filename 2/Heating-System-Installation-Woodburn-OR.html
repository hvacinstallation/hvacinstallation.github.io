<p>The purpose of a lot of building ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for resident convenience while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing security at sensible energy costs. Load computing is described as the Manual J calculation and ought to be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or unit cost for a/c. If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based upon experience or on square footage alone, move to another contractor.

(He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
