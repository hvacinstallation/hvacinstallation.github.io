<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to provide car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
