Load calculating is referred to as the Handbook J computation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or unit cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video alone. Similar to measuring the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, figuring out the appropriate size of system for your home also depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
