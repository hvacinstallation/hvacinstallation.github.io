<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller house, which will impact installation expenses.

Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level.

All objects in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the radiant heat system has been running for a while, consisting of individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
