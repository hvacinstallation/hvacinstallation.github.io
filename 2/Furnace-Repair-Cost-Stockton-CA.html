Dust can serve as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can minimize the performance of the coils.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a reference later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight.
