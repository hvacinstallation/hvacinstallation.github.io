<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Sparta MO</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Because staff member wages and other HR expenses will likely be the greatest cost for any HVAC service that works with staff, we're breaking this product out of the general discussion of financial forecasts and into its own classification.
