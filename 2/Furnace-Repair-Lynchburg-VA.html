That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off prior to it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In fact, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
