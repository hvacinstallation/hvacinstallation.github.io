<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have been correctly dried. Try a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>

The more occupants there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outside air must be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
