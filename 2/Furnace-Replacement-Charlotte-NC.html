<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
