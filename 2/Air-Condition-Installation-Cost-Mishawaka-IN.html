<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Make certain all the registers in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers.
