Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, because a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior.

Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>

<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

The female crimp adapters ought to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight.
