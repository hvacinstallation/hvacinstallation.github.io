<p>The heatpump acquired popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heatpump can extract heat from numerous sources, such as environmental air, exhaust air from a structure, or from the ground. Heat pumps transfer heat from outside the structure into the air within. Initially, heatpump HVAC systems were only used in moderate climates, however with improvements in low temperature level operation and lowered loads due to more efficient houses, they are increasing in popularity in cooler environments.<p>
<p>Selecting the ideal size central air conditioning system for your home is very important, as is picking either a package system, which keeps condenser, fan and coil all in one system, or a split system, which puts the condenser outside the home and the fan and coil within.
