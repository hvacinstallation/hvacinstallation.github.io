<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Shut off the power. Turn the cooling service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work correctly after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC will not work totally unless you do this.<p>
