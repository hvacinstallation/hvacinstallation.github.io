<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was sort of unusual being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we assured it was all intact. The item was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we fixed issues. I would advise this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their restroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>

<h3>HVAC Repair Quotes in Morgantown PA</h3>
<p>Home heating systems are made complex systems that need the services of a contractor to install. While you can certainly purchase your furnace yourself, many contractors won't guarantee the furnace or may not install it if you do not purchase it from them. Installation charges vary across the county, but begin at approximately $50 per hour up to $150 or more. It takes approximately 5 hours to install a small furnace and more to install a big one.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. When going shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit comfortably into the window, be sure to have those dimensions on hand. Likewise, keep fire security in mind when choosing where to install the ac system: Do not put it in an egress window that works as the only means of escape should a fire erupt.<p>
<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly treat and harden-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>The primary health effect related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may position risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
