<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
