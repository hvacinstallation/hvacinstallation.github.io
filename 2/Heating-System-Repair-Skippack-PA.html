<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
