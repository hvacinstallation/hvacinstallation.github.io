This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While space cooling supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is typically more pricey than central air.<p>
