Nevertheless, direct exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible for the most part, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the released spores.

<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ problem. Your company needs to examine measurements of humidity, air and temperature flow.
