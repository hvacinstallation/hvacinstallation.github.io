<p>In a lot of cases, if products have stopped working to dry a number of days after the believed water occasion, mold development is thought within wall cavities even if it is not right away visible.

In a circumstance where there shows up mold and the indoor air quality might have been jeopardized, mold removal might be needed. Mold screening and examinations must be carried out by an independent private investigator to avoid any conflict of interest and to insure precise results; free mold screening provided by remediation companies is not recommended.<p>
