<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather.

The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather considerable.<p>

CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
