<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues.

Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
