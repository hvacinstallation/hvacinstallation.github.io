<p>Central air conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floorings, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioner to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
