<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
