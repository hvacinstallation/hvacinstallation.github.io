<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters homes through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. Exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon becomes caught in structures and concentrations build up inside.<p>
