<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
