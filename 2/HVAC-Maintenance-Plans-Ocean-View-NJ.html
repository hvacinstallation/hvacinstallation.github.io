<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered by a Ocean View NJ HVAC Company</h3>
<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise houses bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has watched the single-family house installation company completely turn on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
