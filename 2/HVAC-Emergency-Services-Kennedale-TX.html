<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable higher airflow from the outside, air quality monitoring platforms and sensors, and new air filtration technologies are becoming more common as readily available services in commercial and residential HVAC product bundles.

<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are used to seeing this key in the backyards of homes.

<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices producer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in place.

The majority of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't simply break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the result of recurring usage of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature deterioration, leading to holes and cracks. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.. an extremely advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
