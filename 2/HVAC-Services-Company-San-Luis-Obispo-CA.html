<p>A lot of well and city water does not typically contain lead. Water generally picks up lead inside the house from family plumbing that is made with lead products. The only way to understand if there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to discover how to get the water evaluated. Send for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to find out more about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water.

There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
