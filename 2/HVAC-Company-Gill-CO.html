<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
