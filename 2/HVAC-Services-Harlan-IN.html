<h3>Ductless AC System in Harlan IN</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
