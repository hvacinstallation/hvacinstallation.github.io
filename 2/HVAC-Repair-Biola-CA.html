<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives ask for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, much of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem.

Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, because some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
