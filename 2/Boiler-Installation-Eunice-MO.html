<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to work till you buy a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
