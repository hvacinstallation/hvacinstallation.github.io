<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, schools and homes matters, especially since we invest the majority of our lives inside. Ac system assist to dehumidify the inbound air, however in extremely damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c unit will need more energy to cool your home.

If your system is near, or past, its anticipated life expectancy, replacement might be the most economical option.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or completely confine it. Any air flow constraint will decrease the system's performance. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
