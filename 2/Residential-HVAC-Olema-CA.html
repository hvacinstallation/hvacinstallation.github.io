<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is likewise a choice for property owners to think about. Often times, these units include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, because the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally only available for larger houses due to their high power and capability.
