Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
