<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
