Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
