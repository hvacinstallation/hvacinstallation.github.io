<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Carnesville GA Home</h3>
<p>In the last a number of years, a growing body of clinical proof has suggested that the air within houses and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outside air in even the largest and most industrialized cities. Other research study shows that people spend around 90 percent of their time inside. Therefore, for many individuals, the dangers to health may be greater due to direct exposure to air pollution indoors than outdoors.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
