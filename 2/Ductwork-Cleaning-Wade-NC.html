<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
