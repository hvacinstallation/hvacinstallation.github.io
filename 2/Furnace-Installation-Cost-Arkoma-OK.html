<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being airborne, and therefore, are quickly breathed in. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat irritant could induce an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to supply sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
