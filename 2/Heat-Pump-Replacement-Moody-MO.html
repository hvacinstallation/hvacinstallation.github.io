<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>

<p>Most HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that enable property owners to control the temperature level and set it on a schedule. For example, you can set the thermostat to decrease the heat when you're not in house to conserve cash on the energy expenses and ensure the system isn't overburdened. A professional technician will check the thermostat throughout the annual maintenance to make sure the actual temperature level and the temperature level on the thermostat matches. If there's a distinction in the temperature level, the technician needs to check the thermostat's performance or assess the entire HVAC system.<p>
