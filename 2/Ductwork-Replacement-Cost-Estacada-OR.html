<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>

Our NATE-certified convenience advisors will quickly diagnose any pending problems with your system and deal energy efficient options.
