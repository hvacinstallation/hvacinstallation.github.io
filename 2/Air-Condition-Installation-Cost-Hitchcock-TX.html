<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
