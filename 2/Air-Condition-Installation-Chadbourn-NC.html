<h3>Methods to Get the Most out of Your HVAC System in Chadbourn NC</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very delighted that someone as experienced as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the ac system before you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to evaluate AC units even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in autos in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by licensed HVAC technicians. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by numerous people.<p>
