Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan.

<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the goal of owning an organisation was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC company owner need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>
