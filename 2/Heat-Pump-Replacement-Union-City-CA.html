<p>Additionally, clean and even vacuum constantly in the location where your heating system is located. Despite the fact that you might think that emptying the room of all products that might catch fire at some point provides sufficient safety, often other junk such as lint and dust might gather inside the furnace which may cause a fire. Excessive lint and dust will likewise block your filter faster than it must be which will be a blow to your budget as you will have to repair or change the equipment.<p>
<p>There are a couple of possibilities to explain short cycling in very cold weather.

There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. If you need clarity on this concern, contact one of our service technicians.<p>
<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years earlier and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Start by reading the installation handbook and familiarizing yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners.

And for extra assistance, particularly for larger air conditioners, consider buying a steel assistance bracket and install it to the outside home wall, straight listed below the windowsill.<p>
