<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more difficulties, since some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
