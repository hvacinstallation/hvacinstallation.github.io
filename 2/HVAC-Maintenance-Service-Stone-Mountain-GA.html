<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is usually higher than many heatpump alternatives, they can still be extremely efficient, depending on the design you acquire. One of the primary benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to greater temperatures than other heating choices. This means it can warm up your home to the preferred temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two need to not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is used for creating power in the form of electrical energy. The two operations utilize different procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to attain its objectives.<p>
